Ocean warming (OW) caused by anthropogenic activitiesthreatensocean ecosystems. Moreover, microplastic (MP) pollution in the globalocean is also increasing. However, the combined effects of OW andMPs on marine phytoplankton are unclear. Synechococcus sp., the most ubiquitous autotrophic cyanobacterium, was used toevaluate the response to OW + MPs under two warming scenarios (28and 32 degrees C compared to 24 degrees C). The enhancement of the cellgrowth rate and carbon fixation under OW were weakened by MP exposure.Specifically, OW + MPs reduced carbon fixation by 10.9 and 15.4% at28 and 32 degrees C, respectively. In addition, reduction in photosynthesispigment contents of Synechococcus sp. under OW wasintensified under OW + MPs, supporting the lower growth rate and carbonfixation under OW + MPs. Transcriptome plasticity (the evolutionaryand adaptive potential of gene expression in response to changingenvironments) enabled Synechococcus sp. to developa warming-adaptive transcriptional profile (downregulation of photosynthesisand CO2 fixation) under OW. Nevertheless, the downregulationof photosynthesis and CO2 fixation were alleviated underOW + MPs to increase responsiveness to the adverse effect. Due tothe high abundances of Synechococcus sp. and itscontributions to primary production, these findings are importantfor understanding the effects of MPs on carbon fixation and oceancarbon fluxes under global warming.","2023-06-08","2025-03-12 19:31:38","2025-03-12 19:31:38","","9005-9017","","24","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001006229400001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We incubated Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus under present-day (380 ppm) or predicted year-2100 CO2 levels (750 ppm), and under normal versus elevated temperatures (+4 degrees C) in semicontinuous cultures. Increased temperature stimulated the cell division rates of Synechococcus but not Prochlorococcus. Doubled CO2 combined with elevated temperature increased maximum chl a-normalized photosynthetic rates of Synechococcus four times relative to controls. Temperature also altered other photosynthetic parameters (alpha, Phi(max), E-k, and Delta F/F-m') in Synechococcus, but these changes were not observed for Prochlorococcus. Both increased CO2 and temperature raised the phycobilin and chl a content of Synechococcus, while only elevated temperature increased divinyl chl a in Prochlorococcus. Cellular carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) quotas, but not phosphorus (P) quotas, increased with elevated CO2 in Synechococcus, leading to similar to 20% higher C:P and N:P ratios. In contrast, Prochlorococcus elemental composition remained unaffected by CO2, but cell volume and elemental quotas doubled with increasing temperature while maintaining constant stoichiometry. Synechococcus showed a much greater response to CO2 and temperature increases for most parameters measured, compared with Prochlorococcus. Our results suggest that global change could influence the dominance of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus ecotypes, with likely effects on oligotrophic food-web structure. However, individual picocyanobacteria strains may respond quite differently to future CO2 and temperature increases, and caution is needed when generalizing their responses to global change in the ocean.","2007-06","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","485-496","","3","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000246686100008","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After several hundred generations under thermal selection, changes in growth parameters, as well as N and C fixation rates, suggested that Trichodesmium did not adapt to the three selection temperature regimes during the 2-year evolution experiment, but could instead rapidly and reversibly acclimate to temperature shifts from 20 degrees C to 34 degrees C.

A three-way full factorial design was used to investigate the combined effects of a chemical stressor (calcium decline from 20 to 5 mg L-1), a biological stressor (50 % Microcystis aeruginosa in diets), and a physical stressor (temperature increase from 25 to 29 degrees C) on the population fitness of three common cladocerans with distinct body sizes. Both Ca deficiency and increasing cyanobacteria significantly depressed fitness in the large-bodied Daphnia pulex, while warming did not. The combined effect of Ca deficiency and increasing cyanobacteria was significantly synergistic in D. pulex with a greater fitness reduction in the presence of cyanobacteria. Ca deficiency significantly depressed Simocephalus vetulus fitness only at 29 degrees C. Ca deficiency and warming had a synergistic effect on S. vetulus fitness, but the combined effect of warming and cyanobacteria was antagonistic. The fitness of the small-bodied B. longirostris increased with temperature, but was not influenced by Ca deficiency, cyanobacteria, or the interactions of the three stressors.

They play a vital role in the ocean by driving the circulation of matter and the flow of energy via the absorption of considerable amounts of carbon dioxide and the release of dissolved organic matter. This dissolved organic matter is converted into biomass by marine heterotrophs, which keeps the cycling of elements in oligotrophic waters at equilibrium. Prochlorococcus, an ecologically important genus of cyanobacteria, is the smallest and most abundant oxygenic phototroph in the global ocean. Prochlorococcus has highly streamlined genomes, which can provide a competitive advantage in the oligotrophic surface waters; however, the streamlined genomes also force Prochlorococcus to adapt to a narrow range of environmental parameters. Owing to these genomic characteristics, Prochlorococcus often establishes interactions with heterotrophic bacteria to survive in the challenging marine environment. Because cyanobacteria are abundant in the ocean, the cyanobacteria-heterotrophic bacteria relationship can significantly affect marine carbon sequestration and storage, which in turn has important ecological implications. Previous studies have reported on the relationships between Prochlorococcus and various heterotrophic bacteria. For example, Prochlorococcus establishes positive interactions with Alteromonas sp. that enhance its growth rate and environmental adaptability. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of the interaction patterns between Prochlorococcus and heterotrophic bacteria, as well as their genetic, physiological, and ecological significance. Prochlorococcus and heterotrophic bacteria tend to form mutualistic relationships in which they directly or indirectly exchange metabolites or recycle organic carbon through complementary excretion and crosstalk between pathways, such as citrate, glycolate, and malate pathways. Prochlorococcus and heterotrophic bacteria also commonly establish commensal relationships. For instance, heterotrophic bacteria protect Prochlorococcus by scavenging hydrogen peroxide, which Prochlorococcus is sensitive to. Although many heterotrophic bacteria cannot synthesize vitamin B-12, they require it as a cofactor for essential functions. Their genetic characteristics suggest that most cyanobacteria have the pathways for synthesizing vitamin B-12, but that they may provide vitamin B-12 to heterotrophic bacteria to promote the growth of ""helper"" in the oligotrophic ocean. Therefore, the interactions between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria help maintain the stability and diversity of marine ecosystems. Global climate change may influence cyanobacteria-heterotrophic bacteria interactions, which could directly affect the structure and dynamics of the microbial community in the oligotrophic ocean, and therefore, primary productivity and element cycling in the ocean. Here, we suggest future research priorities and potential applications based on newfound knowledge of the subject. First, using the known ""heterotrophic bacteria-cyanobacteria"" relationships, the cultivation of marine heterotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria and their viruses should be promoted to build a more comprehensive ""cyanobacteria-heterotrophic bacteria-virus"" ecological model for marine environments. Second, the interaction mechanisms between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria should be revealed by new biotechnologies, such as (meta) genomics, (meta) transcriptomics, (meta) proteomics, and (meta) metabolomics.Third, cyanobacteria-heterotrophic bacteria interactions should be studied against the backdrop of climate change using both ex situ (i.e., laboratory) and in situ investigations to predict changes in marine microbial community and its potential impact on biogeochemical cycling in oceans.","2021","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","3839-3848","","30","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000715757500007","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying thermal acclimation in cyanobacterial taxa that dominate vast oligotrophic regions of the ocean, such as the Synechococcus clade II, remain unknown. Here, we analysed the physiological and global transcriptional response of an ecologically relevant clade II strain (Synechococcus sp. RS9907) to long-term thermal acclimation at temperatures from 20 to 33 degrees C. The growth rate in RS9907 increased linearly with temperature up to the warm threshold (33 degrees C), but genes related with the heat-shock response were upregulated within the range of 28 to 33 degrees C, indicating significant cellular stress under warm conditions. Carbon fixation and assimilation genes (rcbLS, cbbA, zwf, glgP) showed minimum expression values at 20 degrees C and 33 degrees C, but the diel expression patterns of these genes remained unaffected by temperature conditions, being consistently upregulated during day-time. By contrast, some genes involved in photosynthesis (acpA, psbABO, psaABD) were strongly upregulated during night-time under warm conditions, suggesting regulatory imbalances during the diel cycle. Notably, the expression of genes related to the synthesis of osmolytes against salt stress and fatty acid desaturases, which are typically upregulated under cold temperature in other cyanobacteria, was induced in warm acclimated RS9907 cells. These results highlight distinct transcriptional mechanisms of thermal acclimation in members of the Synechococcus clade II compared to other cyanobacterial lineages. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the diverse and intricate ways in which marine cyanobacteria adapt to temperature fluctuations.","2025-01","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001434167500001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rising temperature decreased growth rate, contents of chlorophyll a, protein and sugar in the nitrate-grown cells, but only decreased protein content and significantly increased zeaxanthin content of the urea-grown cells. Expressions of CsoS2 protein involved in carboxysome formation and ribosomal subunits in both nitrate- and urea-grown cells were significantly decreased in rising temperature, whereas carbohydrate selective porin and sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) were remarkably up-regulated, and carbohydrate degradation associated proteins, i.e., glycogen phosphorylase kinase, fructokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, were down-regulated in the urea-grown cells. Rising temperature also increased expressions of three redox-sensitive enzymes (peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin, and CP12) in both nitrate-and urea-grown cells. Our results indicated that rising temperature did not enhance cell growth of Synechococcus; on the contrary, it impaired cell functions, and this might influence cell abundance and distribution of Synechococcus in a future ocean.","2019-08-23","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000482414100002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the molecular basis of thermal acclimation in this cyanobacterium remains unexplored. We analyzed the transcriptional response of the Prochlorococcus marinus strain MIT9301 in long-term acclimations and in natural Prochlorococcus populations along a temperature range enabling its growth (17 to 30 degrees C). MIT9301 upregulated mechanisms of the global stress response at the temperature minimum (17 degrees C) but maintained the expression levels of genes involved in essential metabolic pathways (e.g., ATP synthesis and carbon fixation) along the whole thermal niche. Notably, the declining growth of MIT9301 from the optimum to the minimum temperature was coincident with a transcriptional suppression of the photosynthetic apparatus and a dampening of its circadian expression patterns, indicating a loss in their regulatory capacity under cold conditions. Under warm conditions, the cellular transcript inventory of MIT9301 was strongly streamlined, which may also induce regulatory imbalances due to stochasticity in gene expression. The daytime transcriptional suppression of photosynthetic genes at low temperature was also observed in metatranscriptomic reads mapping to MIT9301 across the global ocean, implying that this molecular mechanism may be associated with the restricted distribution of Prochlorococcus to temperate zones. IMPORTANCE Prochlorococcus is a major marine primary producer with a global impact on atmospheric CO2 fixation. This cyanobacterium is widely distributed across the temperate ocean, but virtually absent at latitudes above 40 degrees for yet unknown reasons. Temperature has been suggested as a major limiting factor, but the exact mechanisms behind Prochlorococcus thermal growth restriction remain unexplored. This study brings us closer to understanding how Prochlorococcus functions under challenging temperature conditions, by focusing on its transcriptional response after long-term acclimation from its optimum to its thermal thresholds. Our results show that the drop in Prochlorococcus growth rate under cold conditions was paralleled by a transcriptional suppression of the photosynthetic machinery during daytime and a loss in the organism's regulatory capacity to maintain circadian expression patterns. Notably, warm temperature induced a marked shrinkage of the organism's cellular transcript inventory, which may also induce regulatory imbalances in the future functioning of this cyanobacterium.","2023-06-27","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000970668200001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A co-culture of Synechococcus sp. RS9907 and their associated heterotrophic bacteria, after determining their taxonomic affiliation by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was acclimated and maintained in the lab at different temperatures (24-34 degrees C). The abundance and cellular properties of Synechococcus and the three dominant heterotrophic bacterial groups (pertaining to the genera Paracoccus, Marinobacter, and Muricauda) were monitored by flow cytometry. The activation energy of Synechococcus, which grew at 0.94-1.38 d(-1), was very similar (0.34 +/- 0.02 eV) to the value hypothesized by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) for autotrophs (0.32 eV), while the values of the three heterotrophic bacteria ranged from 0.16 to 1.15 eV and were negatively correlated with their corresponding specific growth rates (2.38-24.4 d(-1)). The corresponding carrying capacities did not always follow the inverse relationship with temperature predicted by MTE, nor did we observe a consistent response of bacterial cell size and temperature. Our results show that the responses to future ocean warming of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in microbial consortia might not be well described by theoretical universal rules.","2021-05-10","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000652970900001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While thriving in the warm oligotrophic gyres, Prochlorococcus concentrations drop rapidly in higher-latitude regions. Transect data from the North Pacific show the collapse occurring at a wide range of temperatures and latitudes (temperature is often hypothesized to cause this shift), suggesting an ecological mechanism may be at play. An often used size-based theory of phytoplankton community structure that has been incorporated into computational models correctly predicts the dominance of Prochlorococcus in the gyres, and the relative dominance of larger cells at high latitudes. However, both theory and computational models fail to explain the poleward collapse. When heterotrophic bacteria and predators that prey nonspecifically on both Prochlorococcus and bacteria are included in the theoretical framework, the collapse of Prochlorococcus occurs with increasing nutrient supplies. The poleward collapse of Prochlorococcus populations then naturally emerges when this mechanism of ""shared predation"" is implemented in a complex global ecosystem model. Additionally, the theory correctly predicts trends in both the abundance and mean size of the heterotrophic bacteria. These results suggest that ecological controls need to be considered to understand the biogeography of Prochlorococcus and predict its changes under future ocean conditions. Indirect interactions within a microbial network can be essential in setting community structure.","2022-01-11","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","2","119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000768580200005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is growing awareness that maternal effects not only are common but can also significantly impact ecological interactions. Although climate change is broadly studied, relatively little is known regarding its influence on maternal effects in zooplankton. Given that lakes are sentinels for climate change and that elevated temperatures and nutrient pollution can favor phytoplankton dominance by toxic cyanobacteria, this study focused on elucidating the effects of maternal exposure to elevated temperatures on the tolerance of zooplankton offspring to toxic cyanobacteria in the diet. Three different maternal thermal environments were used to examine population fitness in the offspring of two cladoceran species that vary in size, including the larger Daphnia similoides and the smaller Moina macrocopa, directly challenged by toxic Microcystis. Daphnia and Moina mothers exposed to elevated temperatures produced offspring that were more resistant to Microcystis. Such findings may result from life-history optimization of mother's in different temperature environments. Interestingly, offspring from Moina fed with toxic Microcystis performed better than Daphnia offspring, which could partially explain the dominance of small cladocerans typically observed during cyanobacterial blooms. The present study emphasizes the importance of maternal effects on zooplankton resistance to cyanobacteria mediated through environmental warming and further highlights the complexities associated with the abiotic factors that influence zooplanktOn-cyanobacteria interactions.

Warming and changes in nutrient supply may alter the ecological niche of nitrogen-fixing organisms, or 'diazotrophs', however, impacts of warming on diazotroph physiology may also be important. Lab-based studies reveal that warming increases the nitrogen fixation-specific elemental use efficiency (EUE) of two prevalent marine diazotrophs, Crocosphaera and Trichodesmium, thus reducing their requirements for the limiting nutrients iron and phosphorus. Here, we coupled a new diazotroph model based upon observed diazotroph energetics of growth and resource limitation to a state-of-the-art global model of phytoplankton physiology and ocean biogeochemistry. Our model is able to address the integrated response of nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera to warming under the IPCC high emission RCP8.5 scenario for the first time. Our results project a global decline in nitrogen fixation over the coming century. However, the regional response of nitrogen fixation to climate change is modulated by the diazotroph-specific thermal performance curves and EUE, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, which shapes global trends. Spatially, the response of both diazotrophs is similar with expansion towards higher latitudes and reduced rates of nitrogen fixation in the lower latitudes. Overall, 95%-97% of the nitrogen fixation climate signal can be attributed to the combined effect of temperature on the niche and physiology of marine diazotrophs, with decreases being associated with a reduced niche and increases resulting due to a combination of expanding niche and temperature driven changes to EUE. Climate change impacts on both the niche and physiology of marine diazotrophs interact to shape patterns of marine nitrogen fixation, which will have important implications for ocean productivity in the future.","2022-12","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","7078-7093","","23","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000853299700001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Picoplankton mortality due to grazing was generally higher than that caused by viral lysis, especially in the cold months. The largest part of HNF carbon demand was satisfied by grazing on bacteria throughout the year. Although ciliates satisfied their carbon demand predominantly through grazing on HNF and bacteria, the role of autotrophic picoplankton (APP) as their prey increased significantly in the cold months. Bacteria constituted the most important host for viruses throughout the year. However, during the warm months, APP groups were also significant hosts for viral infection. Under the warming condition the amount of picoplankton biomass transferred to protozoan grazers exceeded the lysed biomass, suggesting that global warming could further increase picoplankton carbon flow toward higher trophic levels in the Adriatic Sea.","2018-10","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","10","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000448167900020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While these studies provide insight into the evolutionary responses of single species, they tend to employ different experimental techniques. Consequently, our ability to compare the potential for thermal adaptation across different, ecologically relevant, species remains limited. Here, we address this limitation by conducting simultaneous long-term warming experiments with the same experimental design on clonal isolates of three phylogenetically diverse species of marine phytoplankton; the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp., the prasinophyte Ostreococcus tauri and the diatom Phaeodoactylum tricornutum. Over the same experimental time period, we observed differing levels of thermal adaptation in response to stressful supra-optimal temperatures. Synechococcus sp. displayed the greatest improvement in fitness (i.e., growth rate) and thermal tolerance (i.e., temperature limits of growth). Ostreococcus tauri was able to improve fitness and thermal tolerance, but to a lesser extent. Finally, Phaeodoactylum tricornutum showed no signs of adaptation. These findings could help us understand how the structure of phytoplankton communities may change in response to warming, and possible biogeochemical implications, as some species show relatively more rapid adaptive shifts in their thermal tolerance.","2023-07-03","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001019607900001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The associated environmental/operational cost of wastewater treatment necessitates upgrade of applied processes towards the goals of sustainability and mitigation of climate change. The implementation of cyanobacteria-based processes can contribute to these goals via resources recovery, production of high-value products, carbon fixation and green-energy production. The present study evaluates the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (S7942) as a biological component for novel and sustainable alternatives to typical biological nutrient removal processes. Valuable results regarding cultivation temperature boundaries, applied disinfection techniques and analytical methods, as well as regarding relations between parameters expressing S7942 biomass concentration are presented. The results show that at typical industrial wastewater temperatures, S7942 efficiently grew and removed nitrates from treated snack-industry's wastewater. Moreover, in cultures with treated and relatively saline dairy wastewater, its growth rate slightly decreased, but nevertheless nitrates removal rate remained efficiently high. A comparison between typical denitrification processes and the proposed nutrient removal process indicated that a S7942-based system may constitute an alternative or a supplementary to denitrification process. Thus, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 proved to be a potent candidate towards sustainable industrial wastewater treatment applications.","2021-09-15","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","1438-1451","","6","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000685546000001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that based on the laboratory data, the optimal temperatures for picophytoplankton growth were not significantly different from those of other phytoplankton after controlling the effect of environmental mean temperature; however, the activation energies of picophytoplankton were marginally significantly higher than those of larger phytoplankton. From the field data, the growth rates of Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes in creased with increasing temperature and nitrate and chl a concentrations, whereas the growth rates of Prochlorococcus were not dependent on temperature and decreased with light intensity and nitrate concentrations.

We acclimated sea hares to OW and/or OA across three developmental stages (metamorphic, juvenile, and adult) or as adults only, and compare these to sea hares maintained under current-day conditions. Generally, locomotion speed and time to locate food were reduced similar to 1.5- to 2-fold when the stressors (OW or OA) were experienced in isolation, but reduced similar to 3-fold when combined. Decision-making was also severely altered, with correct foraging choice nearly 40% lower under combined stressors. Metabolic rate appeared to acclimate to the stressors in isolation, but was significantly elevated under combined stressors. Overall, sea hares that developed under OW and/or OA exhibited a less severe impact, indicating beneficial phenotypic plasticity. Reduced foraging success coupled with increased metabolic demands may impact fitness in this species and highlight potentially large ecological consequences under unabated OW and OA, namely in regulating toxic cyanobacteria blooms on coral reefs.","2020-03-25","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000560016100002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Kyucho is an intrusion of warm surface water from the Kuroshio in the Pacific Ocean. Bottom intrusion, which contains a large amount of nitrates, phosphates, and silicates, slips through just above the continental shelf. We investigated seasonal changes in the abundance of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and eukaryotic picophytoplankton while monitoring Kyucho and bottom intrusion from March to October 2002. Kyucho and bottom intrusion frequently occurred from June to September. Relatively high concentrations of nitrate + nitrite (> 0.8 mu mol N l(-1)) and phosphate (> 0.1 mu mol P l(-1)) were found when bottom intrusion occurred. The cell densities of Prochlorococcus were relatively high (> 1 X 10(4) cells ml(-1)) when Kyucho occurred. Those of Synechococcus were high (2 to 30 x 10(4) Cells ml-1) during the period of thermal stratification except in July, when bottom intrusion occurred. The cell densities of eukaryotic picophytoplankton were high (2 to 8 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) in May and July. To examine the effects on picophytoplankton growth of the nutrients supplied by bottom intrusion, we conducted nutrient-enrichment experiments. The growth rates of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were not stimulated by the addition of any kinds of nutrients. The growth rates of Prochlorococcus were negative in most cases. In July, the growth rate of eukaryotic picophytoplankton was stimulated by nitrate and phosphate additions. Thus, Prochlorococcus detected in Uchiumi Bay might have been transported by Kyucho from the Pacific Ocean and could therefore not grow vigorously. Synechococcus may have been flushed out by bottom intrusion, and its growth was not limited by the nutrient concentrations. Eukaryotic picophytoplankton was abundant in spring, and its growth might have been limited by the nutrient concentrations in some cases. These results suggest that Kyucho and bottom intrusion have different effects on the abundance and growth rate of the 3 picophytoplankton groups.","2005","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","59-67","","","298","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000231905600005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum are known to harbor diverse microbial communities that mediate C and nitrogen (N) cycling in peatlands, the effects of climate change on Sphagnum microbiome composition and functioning are largely unknown. We investigated the impacts of experimental whole-ecosystem warming on the Sphagnum moss microbiome, focusing on N-2 fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs). To characterize the microbiome response to warming, we performed next-generation sequencing of small subunit (SSU) rRNA and nitrogenase (nifH) gene amplicons and quantified rates of N-2 fixation activity in Sphagnum fallax individuals sampled from experimental enclosures over 2 years in a northern Minnesota, USA bog. The taxonomic diversity of overall microbial communities and diazotroph communities, as well as N-2 fixation rates, decreased with warming (p < 0.05). Following warming, diazotrophs shifted from a mixed community of Nostocales (Cyanobacteria) and Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) to predominance of Nostocales. Microbiome community composition differed between years, with some diazotroph populations persisting while others declined in relative abundance in warmed plots in the second year. Our results demonstrate that warming substantially alters the community composition, diversity, and N-2 fixation activity of peat moss microbiomes, which may ultimately impact host fitness, ecosystem productivity, and C storage potential in peatlands.","2019-09","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","2993-3004","","9","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000474117900001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we assessed cyanobacteria blooms in a shallow, Mediterranean, highly eutrophic lake (Lake Pamvotis, NW Greece) in relation to critical environmental parameters using a multi-approach methodology. Microscopic (identification of cyanobacteria), immunological (ELISA), and molecular techniques (PCR) combined with physico-chemical parameters were used to monitor cyanobacteria blooms and the associated cyanotoxin production for 14 months on a monthly basis. Cyanobacteria were the main phytoplankton component, representing more than 75% of the total phytoplankton abundance throughout the study period; dominant species belonged to Microcystis, Anabaena and Aphanizomenon. Microcystins (MCs) were detected throughout the year in all sampling stations in concentrations ranging from 0.16 to 27 mu g L-1, indicating that toxic Anabaena and Microcystis strains are persistent and dominant. Saxitoxins (STXs) found in two samples (concentrations 1.3 and 2.1 mu g L-1) in the warm period, are reported here for the first time. The total MC concentration was positively correlated with temperature, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and soluble reactive phosphorus, suggesting that high-temperatures and eutrophic conditions promote the growth of MC-producing genotypes. We also investigated a Micro cystis strain specific growth rate, which reached its maximum at 30 degrees C. Our data, combined with long-term data comparison of key limnological features, spanning a 25-year period, suggest that water temperature and nutrient loads may act synergistically to promote cyanobacterial dominance and persistence in Lake Pamvotis.

As the strength of harmful effects of cyanobacteria on filter-feeding zooplankton is temperature dependent, the global warming scenarios for eutrophic lakes in temperate zone might include an escalated suppression of Daphnia populations caused by the presence of cyanobacterial filaments. To test this assumption, we conducted life-table experiments with four clones of Daphnia magna fed either a green alga Scenedesmus obliquus or a non-toxic strain of filamentous cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in two temperatures (20 degrees C and 24 degrees C). Key life history parameters of Daphnia. i.e., age and size at first reproduction, fecundity, and individual growth rate, were measured. Both food and temperature significantly affected Daphnia performance, however, the effect of interaction of these two factors was ambiguous and highly genotype-dependent. We conclude that the temperature increase within the studied range will not necessarily, strengthen the suppression of Daphnia growth by filamentous cyanobacteria, but may affect clonal selection within population of Daphnia. thus possibly triggering microevolutionary changes within affected populations.","2011","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","353-358","","2","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000294320400024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But far fewer studies have been done on non-calcifying organisms, such as sponges, that have important ecological roles on coral reefs. Here we report the results of a combined thermal stress and ocean acidification experiment on the ecologically dominant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta, found on coral reefs throughout the Caribbean basin. The results show that ocean acidification alone, as well as its interaction with elevated seawater temperature, has significant effects on the sponge microbiome. Specifically, the significant interactive effects of thermal stress and ocean acidification led to a decline in the productivity potential of the symbiotic cyanobacteria in these sponges with a subsequent impact on nutrient transfer, as carbohydrate, between symbiont and host Additionally, while neither environmental stressor predictably changed sponge microbiome community composition, ocean acidification alone reduced the stability of sponge microbiomes and their predicted functions. Future changes in ocean acidification and thermal stress predicted by current climate models could negatively impact the microbiomes of coral reef organisms and therefore also affect their organismal performance and fitness in the future.

Bigger size means higher feeding efficiency and reproduction. However, filamentous cyanobacteria have a more detrimental effect on larger daphnids. Predicted global warming is expected to reduce size of Daphnia and facilitate frequent occurrence of cyanobacteria. Therefore, we asked two questions: (i) does elevated temperature cause reduced size of daphnids, and (ii) is temperature-dependent size reduction adaptive in an environment dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria? To address these issues, we obtained 8 clones of the Daphnia longispina complex from artificially heated lakes and 8 clones from control lakes, and exposed them to a favorable food Scenedesmus obliquus and a mixture of S. obliquus and the filamentous cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in life table experiments at 16, 20, and 24A degrees C. Individuals from heated lakes attained larger body size than those from control lakes. Moreover, exposure to the filamentous cyanobacterium led to reduced fecundity of Daphnia from the non-heated lakes and did not affect reproduction of Daphnia from the heated lakes. We conclude that Daphnia display some evolutionary adaptations to cope with filamentous cyanobacteria, linked to long-term exposition to elevated temperature.

To decipher the effect of changing temperature and CO2 levels on Synechococcus, six Synechococcus strains previously isolated from various coastal and open ocean sites were exposed to a matrix of three different temperatures (22 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 26 degrees C) and CO2 levels (400 ppm, 600 ppm and 800 ppm).

Temperature was found to be a stronger driver of the changes in specific growth rates and photophysiology in the Synechococcus strains.

Amongst the major lineages, clades I and IV preferentially thrive in temperate and cold, nutrient-rich waters, whilst clades II and III prefer warm, nitrogen or phosphorus-depleted waters. The existence of such cold (I/IV) and warm (II/III) thermotypes is corroborated by physiological characterization of representative strains. A fifth clade, CRD1, was recently shown to dominate the Synechococcus community in iron-depleted areas of the world ocean and to encompass three distinct ecologically significant taxonomic units (ESTUs CRD1A-C) occupying different thermal niches, suggesting that distinct thermotypes could also occur within this clade. Here, using comparative thermophysiology of strains representative of these three CRD1 ESTUs we show that the CRD1A strain MITS9220 is a warm thermotype, the CRD1B strain BIOS-U3-1 a cold temperate thermotype, and the CRD1C strain BIOS-E4-1 a warm temperate stenotherm. Curiously, the CRD1B thermotype lacks traits and/or genomic features typical of cold thermotypes. In contrast, we found specific physiological traits of the CRD1 strains compared to their clade I, II, III, and IV counterparts, including a lower growth rate and photosystem II maximal quantum yield at most temperatures and a higher turnover rate of the D1 protein. Together, our data suggests that the CRD1 clade prioritizes adaptation to low-iron conditions over temperature adaptation, even though the occurrence of several CRD1 thermotypes likely explains why the CRD1 clade as a whole occupies most iron-limited waters.","2022-05-09","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000803903300001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To cope with stress, many organisms locally adapt, but how such adaptations affect the ability of an organism to manage co-occurring stressors is not well understood. In aquatic ecosystems, elevated temperatures and harmful algal blooms are common co-stressors. To better understand the role and potential trade-offs of local adaptations for mitigating the effects of stressors, Daphnia pulicaria genotypes that varied in their ability to consume toxic cyanobacteria prey (i.e., three tolerant and three sensitive) were exposed to five diets that included combinations of toxic cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, and a green alga, Ankistrodesmus falcatus, under two temperatures (20 degrees C vs. 28 degrees C). A path analysis was conducted to understand how local adaptations affect energy allocation to intermediate life history traits (i.e., somatic growth, fecundity, survival) that maximize Daphnia fitness (i.e., population growth rate). Results from the 10-day study show that tolerant Daphnia genotypes had higher fitness than sensitive genotypes regardless of diet or temperature treatment, suggesting toxic cyanobacteria tolerance did not cause a decrease in fitness in the absence of cyanobacteria or under elevated temperatures. Results from the path analysis demonstrated that toxic cyanobacteria had a stronger effect on life history traits than temperature and that population growth rate was mainly constrained by reduced fecundity. These findings suggest that local adaptations to toxic cyanobacteria and elevated temperatures are synergistic, leading to higher survivorship of cyanobacteria-tolerant genotypes during summer cyanobacterial bloom events.","2022-02","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","483-492","","2","198","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000751182600001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to effects of temperature and eutrophication, recent research has shed new light on the possible implications of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Depletion of dissolved CO2 by dense cyanobacterial blooms creates a concentration gradient across the air-water interface. A steeper gradient at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations will lead to a greater influx of CO2, which can be intercepted by surface-dwelling blooms, thus intensifying cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria display an unexpected diversity in CO2 responses, because different strains combine their uptake systems for CO2 and bicarbonate in different ways. The genetic composition of cyanobacterial blooms may therefore shift. In particular, strains with high-flux carbon uptake systems may benefit from the anticipated rise in inorganic carbon availability. Increasing temperatures also stimulate cyanobacterial growth. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria and also green algae have temperature optima above 25 degrees C, often exceeding the temperature optima of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Analysis of published data suggests that the temperature dependence of the growth rate of cyanobacteria exceeds that of green algae. Indirect effects of elevated temperature, like an earlier onset and longer duration of thermal stratification, may also shift the competitive balance in favor of buoyant cyanobacteria while eukaryotic algae are impaired by higher sedimentation losses. Furthermore, cyanobacteria differ from eukaryotic algae in that they can fix dinitrogen, and new insights show that the nitrogen-fixation activity of heterocystous cyanobacteria can be strongly stimulated at elevated temperatures. Models and lake studies indicate that the response of cyanobacterial growth to rising CO2 concentrations and elevated temperatures can be suppressed by nutrient limitation. The greatest response of cyanobacterial blooms to climate change is therefore expected to occur in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The growth rates of Synechococcus ranged from -0.016 to 0.051 h(-1) during the experimental period, suggesting that temperature was a primary mechanism controlling Synechococcus growth. In addition to size and relative biomass of pigmented nanoflagellates and Synechococcus, it is suggested that community structures played an important role in trophic link.

OA led to reduced development of proportion of the vegetative cells into diazocytes which included up-regulated genes of nitrogen fixation.

The kinetics of the electron transfer reactions were investigated using a double-modulation fluorometer. The rates of photosynthetic oxygen evolution normalized to equal mean irradiance were lower or equal in the intermittent light compared to the maximum rate found in the equivalent optimal continuous light regime. In contrast, the growth rates in the intermittent light can be higher than the growth rate in the equivalent continuous light. Photoinhibition is presented as an example of a physiological process affecting the growth rate that occurs at different rates in the intermittent and equivalent continuous lights.

Dinoflagellates were the most commonly detected taxa in both water column and trap samples throughout the time series. Diatom sequences were found only eight times in the water column, and only four times in trap material. Small-sized eukaryotic taxa, including the prasinophyte genera Ostreococcus, Micromonas, and Bathycoccus, were present in trap samples, as were the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Synechococcus was usually overrepresented in trap material, whereas Prochlorococcus was underrepresented compared to the water column. Both seasonal and temporal variability affected patterns of ribosomal DNA found in sediment traps. The two years of this study were quite different hydrographically, with higher storm activity and the passing of a cyclonic eddy causing unusually deep mixing in winter 2010. This was reflected in the DGGE fingerprints of the water column, which showed greater phylotype richness of eukaryotes and a lesser richness of cyanobacteria in winter of 2010 compared with the winter of 2009. Increases in eukaryotic richness could be traced to increased diversity of prasinophytes and prymnesiophytes. The decrease in cyanobacterial richness was in turn reflected in the trap composition, but the increase in eukaryotes was not, indicating a disproportionate contribution of certain taxa to sinking particle flux.

To gain insight into the role of temperature and nutrient availability as determinants of picophytoplankton population mean cell size, we carried out five microcosm experiments across the Atlantic Ocean (45 degrees N-27 degrees S) in which surface plankton assemblages were incubated under all combinations of three temperatures (in situ, 3 degrees C cooling and 3 degrees C warming) and two nutrient levels (unamended and addition of nitrogen and phosphorus). The overall range of variability in cell volume was 5-fold for Prochlorococcus, 8-fold for Synechococcus and 6-fold for the picoeukaryotes. We observed, in all the treatments and in the control, a consistent trend toward larger mean cell sizes over time for both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, which was likely the result of sample confinement. Changes in temperature and nutrient status alone did not cause clear changes in cell size, relative to the control, but the combination of warming and nutrient addition resulted in an increase in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus cell size. The largest increases in cell volume were associated with slow or negative population net growth rates.

How ongoing ocean warming may interact with light availability to affect Trichodesmium is not yet clear. We grew Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101 at three temperature levels of 23, 27, and 31 degrees C under growth-limiting and growth-saturating light levels of 50 and 160 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1), respectively, for at least 10 generations and then measured physiological performance, including the specific growth rate, N-2 fixation rate, and photosynthesis. Light availability significantly modulated the growth response of Trichodesmium to temperature, with the specific growth rate peaking at similar to 27 degrees C under the light-saturating conditions, while growth of light-limited cultures was non-responsive across the tested temperatures (23, 27, and 31 degrees C). Short-term thermal responses for N-2 fixation indicated that both high growth temperature and light intensity increased the optimum temperature (T-opt) for N-2 fixation and decreased its susceptibility to supra-optimal temperatures (deactivation energy - E-h). Simultaneously, all light-limited cultures with low T-opt and high E-h were unable to sustain N-2 fixation during short-term exposure to high temperatures (33-34 degrees C) that are not lethal for the cells grown under light-saturating conditions. Our results imply that Trichodesmium spp. growing under low light levels while distributed deep in the euphotic zone or under cloudy weather conditions might be less sensitive to long-term temperature changes that occur on the timescale of multiple generations but are more susceptible to abrupt (less than one generation time span) temperature changes, such as those induced by cyclones and heat waves.","2020-02-28","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","1169-1180","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000518757100002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also found that the area of the ocean where sea surface temperatures (SST) are withinTrichodesmium's thermal niche increased by 32% from the LGM to present, but further increases in SST due to continued global warming will reduce this area by 9%. However, the range reduction at the equator is likely to be offset by enhanced growth associated with expansion of regions with optimal or near optimal Fe and light availability.

Interactions with associated microbiota can affect the physiology of Trichodesmium, often in ways that have been predicted to support its growth. Recently, it was found that trimethylamine (TMA), a globally abundant organic N compound, inhibits N-2 fixation in cultures of Trichodesmium without impairing growth rate, suggesting that Trichodesmium can use TMA as an alternate N source. In this study, N-15-TMA DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) of a Trichodesmium enrichment was employed to further investigate TMA metabolism and determine whether TMA-N is incorporated directly or secondarily via cross-feeding facilitated by microbial associates. Herein, we identify two members of the marine Roseobacter clade (MRC) of Alphaproteobacteria as the likely metabolizers of TMA and provide genomic evidence that they converted TMA into a more readily available form of N, e.g., ammonium (NH4+), which was subsequently used by Trichodesmium and the rest of the community.

Aiming to shed light on the responses of extra-and intracellular inorganic C (C-i) fluxes, the cyanobacterium Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 was grown with different nitrogen sources (N-2 vs NO3-) and pCO(2) levels (380 vs 1400 mu atm). Cellular C-i fluxes were assessed by combining membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS), C-13 fractionation measurements, and modelling. Aside from a significant decrease in C-i affinity at elevated pCO(2) and changes in CO2 efflux with different N sources, extracellular C-i fluxes estimated by MIMS were largely unaffected by the treatments. C-13 fractionation during biomass production, however, increased with pCO(2), irrespective of the N source. Strong discrepancies were observed in CO2 leakage estimates obtained by MIMS and a C-13-based approach, which further increased under elevated pCO(2). These offsets could be explained by applying a model that comprises extracellular CO2 and HCO3- fluxes as well as internal C-i cycling around the carboxysome via the CO2 uptake facilitator NDH-1(4). Assuming unidirectional, kinetic fractionation between CO2 and HCO3- in the cytosol or enzymatic fractionation by NDH-1(4), both significantly improved the comparability of leakage estimates. Our results highlight the importance of internal C-i cycling for C-13 composition as well as cellular energy budgets of Trichodesmium, which ought to be considered in process studies on climate change effects.","2015-02","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","749-759","","3","66","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000351662300012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the promising resources is cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae. They require simple ingredients to grow and possess a relatively simple genome. Cyanobacteria are known to produce a wide variety of bioactive compounds. In addition, cyanobacteria's remarkable growth rate enables its potential use in a wide range of applications in the fields of bioenergy, biotechnology, natural products, medicine, agriculture, and the environment. In this review, we have summarized the potential applications of cyanobacteria in different areas of science and development, especially related to their use in producing biofuels and other valuable co-products. We have also discussed the challenges that hinder such development at an industrial level and ways to overcome such obstacles.","2020-02","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000519101300003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using published data, we show that though there is a strong positive relationship between the mu(max) of all photosynthetic organisms and their P content (% dry weight), leading to a relatively constant P productivity, the relationship with RNA content is more complex. In eukaryotes there is a strong positive relationship between mu(max) and RNA content expressed as % dry weight, and RNA constitutes a relatively constant 25% of total P. In prokaryotes the rRNA operon copy number is the important determinant of the amount of RNA present in the cell. The amount of phospholipid expressed as % dry weight increases with increasing mu(max) in microalgae. The relative proportions of each of the five major P-containing constituents is remarkably constant, except that the proportion of RNA is greater and phospholipids smaller in prokaryotic than eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. The effect of temperature differences between studies was minor. The evidence for and against P-containing constituents other than RNA being involved with ribosome synthesis and functioning is discussed.","2021-04","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","601-611","","2","230","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000621074400001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Environment and zooplankton samples were collected every fortnight, and the copepod Acartia spp. was incubated in the laboratory for reproductive output, i.e. egg production and egg hatching success. Other responses monitored were female: male ratio, mortality and body condition. In addition, molecular analyses of the nodularin-producing cyanobacterium Nodularia in Acartia gut contents (GCs) were assessed. Egg production and body condition decreased with increasing Nodularia GCs. During the bloom, hatching decreased as a response to Nodularia in the copepod gut. Although not related to cyanobacteria variables, male mortality was higher than female mortality, resulting in a female-biased sex ratio over most of the summer. The study demonstrates that Acartia reproductive output is constrained by cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea, and more generally that copepod population dynamics may be negatively affected by such blooms. This is especially significant considering that toxin-producing blooms are predicted to increase due to warming.","2015-03","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","388-398","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000352487600010","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(CCMP 1334) was grown in a continuous culture system on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle at all combinations of low and high pCO(2) (400 and 1000 ppmv, respectively), nutrient availability (nitrate-limited and nutrient-replete conditions), and temperatures of 21, 24, 28, 32, and 35 degrees C. The maximum nutrient-replete growth rate was similar to 1.15 day(-1) at 32-35 degrees C. Median nutrient-replete growth rates were higher at 1000 ppmv than at 400 ppmv pCO(2) at all temperatures. Carbon:nitrogen ratios were independent of pCO(2) at a fixed relative growth rate (i.e., growth rate divided by nutrient-replete growth rate) but decreased with increasing temperature. Carbon:chlorophyll a ratios were decreased monotonically with increasing temperature and were higher under nitrate-limited than nutrient-replete conditions. Ratios of phycoerythrin to chlorophyll a were independent of growth conditions. Productivity indices were independent of temperature and nutrient limitation but were consistently higher at 1000 ppmv than 400 ppmv pCO(2). Both growth rates and dark respiration rates were positively correlated with temperature, and the associated Q(10) values were 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. A model of phytoplankton growth in which cellular carbon is allocated to structure, storage, or the light or dark reactions of photosynthesis accounted for the general patterns of cell composition and growth rate. This strain of Synechococcus appears well suited to changes in environmental conditions that are expected as the climate warms in response to anthropogenic emissions of CO2.","2024-11-30","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001367810100001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To predict future community and bloom dynamics, it is therefore important to understand how bloom-forming species respond to temperature. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya & Subba Raju is an invasive, toxin-producing, nitrogen-fixer that may benefit from warming. To understand how changing temperatures will influence its ability to compete against native North American bloom-formers, we characterized the thermal reaction norms and temperature traits of three C. raciborskii strains, four strains of Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing and one strain of Anabaena flos-aquae (Lyng.) Breb. C. raciborskii strains had higher optimum temperatures and survived higher temperatures than toxic M. aeruginosa strains, but had no apparent advantage over the non-toxic M. aeruginosa strain or A. flosaquae. M. aeruginosa strains and A. flos-aquae tolerated lower temperatures than C. raciborskii, suggesting that fitness differences at low temperature may be important in limiting the latter's spread. Furthermore, we found that nutrient availability strongly influenced thermal reaction norm shape: nitrogen deprivation lowered growth rates and decreased both low-and high-temperature tolerance, but did not affect the optimum temperature in C. raciborskii.","2016-01","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","357-369","","1","763","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000365726600027","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of their ability to fix gaseous nitrogen and carbon dioxide to organic materials, they are known to play important roles in the universal nutrient cycle. Cyanobacteria has emerged as one of the promising resources to combat the issues of global warming, disease outbreaks, nutrition insecurity, energy crises as well as persistent daily human population increases. Cyanobacteria possess significant levels of macro and micronutrient substances which facilitate the versatile popularity to be utilized as human food and protein supplements in many countries such as Asia. Cyanobacteria has been employed as a complementary dietary constituent of feed for poultry and as vitamin and protein supplement in aquatic lives. They are effectively used to deal with numerous tasks in various fields of biotechnology, such as agricultural (including aquaculture), industrial (food and dairy products), environmental (pollution control), biofuel (bioenergy) and pharmaceutical biotechnology (such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, anticoagulant and antitumor); recently, the growing interest of applying them as biocatalysts has been observed as well. Cyanobacteria are known to generate a numerous variety of bioactive compounds. However, the versatile potential applications of cyanobacteria in biotechnology could be their significant growth rate and survival in severe environmental conditions due to their distinct and unique metabolic pathways as well as active defensive mechanisms. In this review, we elaborated on the versatile cyanobacteria applications in different areas of biotechnology. We also emphasized the factors that could impede the implementation to cyanobacteria applications in biotechnology and the execution of strategies to enhance their effective applications.","2022-12","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000904288800001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the spectral composition of light, which changes greatly in a dynamic light environment, could affect their fitness, growth and development. We studied the photobiology of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 using different lights such as white light (WL), red light (RL), green light (GL) and blue light (BL) to investigate the response of the organism to different wavelengths of photosynthetic active radiation. Results obtained suggested that S. elongatus PCC 7942 can not efficiently utilize green and blue wavelengths of light, and the two light colors compromised the fitness and growth of the or-ganism by inducing high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GL and BL, interestingly, increased the lipid content in the biomass and caused decoupling of phycobilisomes from the thylakoid membranes. We report light quality-dependent morphogenesis in S. elongatus PCC 7942 where GL and BL caused cell elongation while RL induced small cell morphology. Gene expression analysis suggested that GL and BL could regulate cell shape by altering the expression of cytoskeleton protein-encoding morphogenes. Thus, it is evident that the growth and fitness of S. elongatus PCC 7942 can be compromised in dense culture or at higher depths in the water column where GL and/or BL-enriched environment prevails. However, decreased fitness is offset by increased lipid content and elongated cellular morphology.","2023-01","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39","","","","","205","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000878640300001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
