However, bloom dynamics are usually ignored in most studies. Here, we investigated the effects of the initial pCO(2) on the bloom characteristics of two cosmopolitan diatoms, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira weissflogii. Batch cultures with two initial pCO(2) conditions (LC: 400 mu atm; HC: 1000 mu atm) were used to investigate bloom dynamics under current and ocean acidification scenarios. The simulated S. costatum bloom was characterized by fast accumulation, a rapid decline in biomass, and a shorter stationary phase. The T. weissflogii bloom had a longer stationary phase, and cell density remained at high levels after culturing for 19 days. The physiological performances of the two diatoms varied significantly in the different bloom phases. We found that the initial pCO(2) has modulating effects on biomass accumulation and bloom dynamics for these two diatoms. The higher initial pCO(2) enhanced the specific growth rate of T. weissflogii by 6% in the exponential phase, leading to higher cell densities, while 86% higher decay rates were observed in the HC cultures of S. costatum. Overall, ocean acidification may alter the dynamics of diatom blooms and may have profound impacts on the biological carbon pump.","2022-03","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","175","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000780192400003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the growth dynamics and photosynthetic efficiency of the aquaculture-relevant diatom Chaetoceros muelleri were monitored and modelled under four different light and CO2 conditions. By increasing the availability of both light and CO2, a growth rate of 1.59 ? 0.12 (day-1) was achieved for C. muelleri, an increase of approximately 89% compared to 0.84 ? 0.08 (day? 1) which was recorded in cultures under light limitation with no CO2 addition. The real-time monitoring and modelling of growth dynamics and photosynthesis rates in different light and CO2 conditions have demonstrated that light availability can be improved by minimizing the path length of light through the culture, and the importance of on-demand CO2 supply.

Temperature plays a crucial role in the synthesis of these fatty acids. This study specifically investigated the impact of temperature on the growth, total lipid content, and fatty acid composition of Skeletonema dohrnii, a planktonic diatom commonly associated with red tides and water blooms in China. The aim is to evaluate its suitability as an aquatic bait and provide insights for large-scale factory farming. Results indicated that the highest biomass and maximum growth rate occurred at 28 degrees C, with no significant deviation from the control group at 25 degrees C. At 28 degrees C and 15 degrees C, there was a significant increase in the total lipid content and the total fatty acid content, with a more pronounced effect at 15 degrees C. At 28 degrees C, EPA and DHA content measured at 0.97 +/- 0.01 mg.DW.L-1 and 0.264 +/- 0.01 mg.DW.L-1 respectively, surpass those at 15 degrees C due to lower biomass. Conversely, at 15 degrees C, substantial synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, with EPA constituting up to 32.24 +/- 0.24% of the total fatty acids, is observed. Modulating the temperature could optimize the utilization of S. dohrnii as an aquatic feed source.

Ocean warming, as a pressing environmental stressor, can profoundly affect the population structure and ecological services of diatoms. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning cellular and physiological changes of diatoms under heat wave and heat selection conditions remain underexplored. This study revealed the transcriptomic and physiological responses of a model diatom species P. tricornutum to ocean warming at an elevated temperature (25 degrees C in comparison with 20 degrees C) under scenarios of heat shock (-7 days; -7 generations) and heat selection (-175 days; -165 generations). While unchanged cell growth and reduced Fv/Fm were recorded in the heat shock treatment, significant reductions in the cell growth rate and Fv/Fm were evident in the heat selection treatment. Contents of Chl-a, carotenoid, total soluble protein, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) increased significantly in both treatments. Transcriptomics analysis showed that elevated temperature suppressed signaling pathways related to photosynthesis but activated signaling pathways involving in fatty acid metabolism and nitrogen metabolism following the heat selection, associated with elevated substance storage and enlarged cell size. As a result, the increase of both C and N suggest that more energy was likely allocated to growth than division under ocean warming. Notably, P. tricornutum showed a higher resistance to nitrogen limitation condition after acclimating to ocean warming possibly by activation of nitrogen metabolism and uptake. P. tricornutum responded to the projected ocean warming through readjusting energy metabolism.","2023-09","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001008813000001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to evaluate the species-specific responses of coastal diatoms to the combined effects of future ocean acidification (OA) and warming on the coastal diatoms, we conducted a semi-continuous incubation on the large centric diatom Thalassiosira sp. (similar to 30 mu m) and small pennate diatom Nitzschia closterium fminutissima (similar to 15 mu m). A full factorial combination of two temperature levels (15 and al-C) and pCO(2) (400 and 1,000 ppm) was examined. The results suggest that changes in temperature played a more important role in regulating the physiology of Thalassiosira sp. and N. closterium f.minutissima than CO2. For Thalassiosira sp., elevated temperature significantly reduced the cellular particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), particulate organic phosphate (POP), biogenic silica (BSi), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and protein contents, and the C:N ratio. CO2 only had significant effects on the growth rate and the protein content. However, for the smaller pennate diatom N. closterium f.minutissima, the growth rate, POC production rate, and the C:P ratio significantly increased with an elevated temperature, whereas the cellular POP and BSi contents significantly decreased. CO2 had significant effects on the POC production rate, cellular BSi, POC, and PON contents, the C:P, Si:C, N:P, and Si:P ratios, and sinking rate. The interaction between OA and warming showed mostly antagonistic effects on the physiology of both species. Overall, by comparison between the two species, CO2 played a more significant role in regulating the growth rate and sinking rate of the large centric diatom Thalassiosira sp., whereas had more significant effects on the elemental compositions of the smaller pennate diatom N. closterium f. minutissima. These results suggest differential sensitivities of different diatom species with different sizes and morphology to the changes in CO2/temperature regimes and their interactions.","2022-06-21","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000886535600001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we experimentally examined the metabolic adaptation of a globally important diatom species Skeletonema dohrnii (S. dohrnii) to OW at two elevated temperatures (24 and 28 degrees C compared with 20 degrees C) under short-term (similar to 300 generations) and long-term (similar to 700 generations selection. Both warming levels significantly increased the cell growth rate but decreased the chlorophyll a content. The contents of particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) decreased significantly initially (i.e., until 300 generations) at two temperature treatments but completely recovered after 700 generations of selection, suggesting that S. dohrnii ultimately developed thermal adaptation. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that elevated temperatures upregulated energy metabolism via glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation as well as nitrogen acquisition and utilization, which in turn reduced substance storage because of trade-off in the 300th generation, thus decreasing POC and PON. Interestingly, populations at both elevated temperatures exhibited significant proteome plasticity in the 700th generation, as primarily demonstrated by the increased lipid catabolism and glucose accumulation, accounting for the recovery of POC and PON. Changes occurring in cells at the 300th and 700th generations demonstrate that S. dohrnii can adapt to the projected OW, and readjusting the energy metabolism is an important adaptive strategy.","2022-04-19","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","5247-5255","","8","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000793137500055","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple stressor studies on Arctic phytoplankton, particularly on the bloom-forming species, may help understand their fitness in response to future climate change, however, such studies are scarce. In the present study, a laboratory experiment was conducted on the bloom-forming Arctic diatom Chaetoceros gelidus (earlier C. socialis) under variable CO2 (240 and 900 mu atm) and light (50 and 100 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) levels. The growth response was documented using the pre-acclimatized culture at 2 degrees C in a closed batch system over 12 days until the dissolved inorganic nitrogen was depleted. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON), pigments, cell density, and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem || (Fv/Fm) were measured on day 4 (D-4), 6 (D-6), 10 (D-10), and 12 (D-12). The overall growth response suggested that C. gelidus maintained a steady-state carboxylation rate with subsequent conversion to macromolecules as reflected in the per-cell POC contents under variable CO2 and light levels. A substantial amount of POC buildup at the low CO2 level (comparable to the high CO2 treatment) indicated the possibility of existing carbon dioxide concentration mechanisms (CCMs) that needs further investigation. Pigment signatures revealed a high level of adaptability to variable irradiance in this species without any major CO2 effect. PON contents per cell increased initially but decreased irrespective of CO2 levels when nitrogen was limited (D-6 onward) possibly to recycle intracellular nitrogen resources resulting in enhanced C:N ratios. On D-12 the decreased dissolved organic nitrogen levels could be attributed to consumption under nitrogen starvation. Such physiological plasticity could make C. gelidus ""ecologically resilient"" in the future Arctic.","2022-11-11","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000890242500001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the possible tradeoff between thermal adaptation and the organism's tolerance to other environmental drivers in a warmer future remains understudied. Here, we designed an evolutionary selection environment where the Red Sea diatom Chaetoceros tenuissimus was adapted to ambient (26 degrees C) and warming (30 degrees C) temperature scenarios for over 2,000 generations. These strains were subsequently exposed to a range of copper (Cu) dose over three assay temperatures (26, 30, and 35 degrees C), to assess whether adaptation to experimental warming is accompanied by a reformed tolerance to toxic pollutants. Most previous studies on Cu toxicity in marine phytoplankton were conducted within a smaller range of temperature (20-25 degrees C), indicating the need for further assessments to reveal the potential complex interactive effects between pollutants and more significant warming in the future. The acute Cu toxicity was estimated in terms of reduction in cell abundance (cells mL(-1)), growth rate (mu) and PSII photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m), with 48 h median effective concentration values (EC50) ranging from 2.22 to 20.19 mu g L-1. We found a statistically significant interaction between assay temperature, selection temperature, and Cu doses in all the criteria tested. However, under the extreme warming scenario (35 degrees C), the Cu sensitivity was significantly reduced, indicating cumulative antagonistic effects between these factors. Adaptation of phytoplankton to higher temperatures may help maintain their heavy metal tolerance, although a shift in temperature during the tests clearly altered their sensitivities. We conclude that selection for warming had made cells more resistant to Cu at the selection temperature in comparison to ambient-adapted population tested at 26 degrees C. However, in warming-adapted cells, this response was traded off against cupper resistance at 26 degrees C.","2019-08-29","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000483055900001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Photochemical efficiency (phi PSII), relative electron transport rate (rETR) and the recovery of phi PSII were determined. HC induced higher cell density and specific growth rate compared with LC. However, no difference was found in chlorophyll between HC and LC. Moreover, phi PSII and rETRs were higher under HC than LC in response to solar UVR. P exposure led to faster recovery of phi PSII, both under HC and LC, than PA and PAB exposure.

Feeding depends on temperature, and recent studies indicate different thermal responses in ingestion and respiration implying a possible metabolic mismatch with increasing temperatures. We investigated the thermal response of ingestion and faecal pellet production as an indicator of egestion of the Arctic copepod C. glacialis in incubation experiments at five temperatures ranging from 0 to 10 A degrees C and compared the obtained data with published results on temperature dependence of respiration. Copepods were fed ad libitum with the diatom Thalassiosira gravida, and algae concentration was assessed prior and after 4 h feeding experiments. Egested faecal pellets were collected and counted. Ingestion and faecal pellet production rates increased linearly (Q (10) coefficient similar to 1.4-1.7 and similar to 1.8-4.1, respectively). No pronounced effect of feeding history (fed vs. starved for 3 days prior to experiment) was found, but responses in both rates were generally less dependent on temperature in the pre-starved experiment. Q (10) values for ingestion rates were lower than Q (10) values for published respiration rates (similar to 1.8-4.6), indicating that metabolic losses increase stronger with increasing temperature than metabolic gains by ingestion. A persistent imbalance between metabolic losses and energy uptake could lead to reduced fitness for C. glacialis, thereby affecting the population dynamics and distribution of this important species in the Arctic.","2015-07","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","1025-1033","","7","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000356535300008","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We previously found that elevated CO2 concentration increased lipid productivity as well as growth in Phaeodactylum tricornutum, along with an enhancement of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) activity. The purpose of this work directed toward the verification of the critical role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the OPPP, in lipid accumulation in P. tricornutum and its simultaneous rapid growth rate under high-CO2 (0.15%) cultivation. Results In this study, G6PDH was identified as a target for algal strain improvement, wherein G6PDH gene was successfully overexpressed and antisense knockdown in P. tricornutum, and systematic comparisons of the photosynthesis performance, algal growth, lipid content, fatty acid profiles, NADPH production, G6PDH activity and transcriptional abundance were performed. The results showed that, due to the enhanced G6PDH activity, transcriptional abundance and NAPDH production, overexpression of G6PDH accompanied by high-CO2 cultivation resulted in a much higher of both lipid content and growth in P. tricornutum, while knockdown of G6PDH greatly decreased algal growth as well as lipid accumulation. In addition, the total proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid, especially the polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5, n-3), were highly increased in high-CO2 cultivated G6PDH overexpressed strains. Conclusions The successful of overexpression and antisense knockdown of G6PDH well demonstrated the positive influence of G6PDH on algal growth and lipid accumulation in P. tricornutum. The improvement of algal growth, lipid content as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids in high-CO2 cultivated G6PDH overexpressed P. tricornutum suggested this G6PDH overexpression-high CO2 cultivation pattern provides an efficient and economical route for algal strain improvement to develop algal-based biodiesel production.","2019-09-23","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000487442400002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In warm tropical seas, evolutionary adaptation by local species to warming will be crucial to avoid predicted desertification and reduction in diversity. However, little is known about the adaptation of phytoplankton in warm seas. Across the ocean, diatomic microalgae are the main primary producers in cold waters; they also contribute to tropical communities where they play a necessary role in the biological pump. Here we show that four species of diatoms isolated from the tropical Red Sea adapted to warming conditions (30 degrees C) after 200-600 generations by using various thermal strategies. Two of the warming adapted species increased their optimal growth temperature (T-opt) and maximum growth rate. The other two diatoms did not increase T-opt and growth, but shifted from specialist to generalist increasing their maximum critical thermal limit. Our data show that tropical diatoms can adapt to warming, although trade offs on photosynthetic efficiency, high irradiance stress, and lower growth rate could alter their competitive fitness. Our findings suggest that adaptive responses to warming among phytoplankton could help to arrest the sharp decline in diversity resulting from climate change that is predicted for tropical waters.","2018-12-11","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000452779600004","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A total of 154 studies consisting 301 experiments were synthesized in this study. Under a projected temperature increase of 3-5 degrees C by IPCC AR6 at the end of this century, our results suggest that the growth and photosynthetic rate of coccolithophores were significantly enhanced by the rising temperature, while the calcification of coccolithophores was only slightly promoted. Warming also had significantly positive effects on the growth but not photosynthesis of diatoms. In comparison, the effect size of warming on the growth rate of coccolithophores was larger than that of diatoms. However, there was no significant effect of warming on either the ratio of particulate inorganic carbon to par-ticulate organic carbon (PIC:POC) of coccolithophores or the ratio of biogenic silica to carbon (BSi:C) of diatoms. Furthermore, the results reveal latitudinal and size-specific patterns of the effect sizes of warming. For diatoms, the effects of warming on growth were more prominent in high latitudes, specifically for the Southern Hemi-sphere species. In addition, the effect size of warming on the small-sized diatoms was larger than that of the large-sized diatoms. For coccolithophores, the growth of the Southern Hemisphere temperate strains was significantly promoted by warming. Overall, the results based on the meta-analysis indicate that the projected warming of the end of this century will be more favor to the growth of coccolithophores than that of diatoms, thus potentially affect the competitive advantages of coccolithophores over diatoms; while the mid-to high latitude species/strains of both coccolithophores and diatoms will benefit more than their counterparts in the lower latitudes. Therefore, this study offers novel insights into predicting both the inter-and intra-group competitive advantages of diatoms and coccolithophores under the future warming climate change scenario.","2024-01","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","193","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001122380000001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The integration of these omics data revealed specific mechanisms that shifted carbon and energy fluxes in T. pseudonana depending on light-driven growth rate. To support a growth rate of >1 d-1 in high light, cells upregulated metabolic pathways involved in the production of long chain fatty acids, glycolic acid, and carbohydrates. Under low light, cells maintained a growth rate of & LE;0.2 d-1 by conserving photosynthetic energy through upregulation of carbon retention pathways (e.g., gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate cycle). The few significant metabolites detected in low light acclimated cells were associated with light harvesting, energy storage, and signalling. In particular, our metabolite data revealed that eicosanoic acid, a metabolite commonly involved in cellular signalling, may poise light limited cells for fast metabolic remodelling with improving light conditions. The combined physiological, gene expression and metabolite profiling data revealed key metabolic switch points that underpin diatom success and could be leveraged in cell-based models for predictions and manipulations of cell growth or bio-production.","2023-07","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001025215400001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When exposed to a change in environmental milieu two main responses can be attained by cells: acclimation or homoeostasis. Recent studies testing the impact of other environmental factors indicated that the choice between these strategies is related to growth rates, i.e. cells dividing at a faster rate showed inclination to acclimation while cells dividing at a slower rate were more prone to homoeostasis. These findings motivated us to further explore the extent to which these compositional response modes are applied under varying temperature. Two representative marine diatoms, one centric, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and one pennate, Cylindrotheca fusiformis were investigated. Species were cultured at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C and at two growth rates. Compositional response was analysed with respect to elemental stoichiometry (carbon, nitrogen, silica, phosphorus, sulphur, manganese, iron, zinc and copper) and the major organic pool ratios (carbohydrate:lipid, carbohydrate:protein and protein:lipid). While T. pseudonana exhibited an acclimation response to temperature, C. fusiformis proved to be strongly homoeostatic. In the case of T. pseudonana, our data showed that the variations in composition were consistent with the growth rate dependence hypothesis for many micronutrients, but not for carbon and nitrogen contents, and C:N ratio. These species-specific differences in response mode highlight the diversity in ecophysiological strategies of diatoms, which needs to be considered when predicting climate change responses.","2021-09-03","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","462-472","","5","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000685998900001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both T. pseudonana and T. punctigera grew faster under medium temperature and longer photoperiod, under the expected optimal instantaneous light intensity. The biovolume-based pigments content of T. pseudonana responded largely to temperature, while that of T. punctigera responded more to photoperiod duration than to temperature. In T. pseudonana, shortest photoperiod enhanced cellular protein content and alleviated their temperature dependency. Continuous growth light reduced the photosynthetic capacity of T. pseudonana at the lowest temperature and reduced that of T. punctigera across temperatures. Moreover, we found the increasing temperature linearly increased the dark respiration rate (Rd) and molar ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) of T. pseudonana but decreased that of T. punctigera, with the scattered effects of photoperiod.

However, their carbon fixation is frequently limited by nutrient availability, which varies regionally and temporally. In general, as a result of global warming, coastal waters are predicted to become more eutrophic, while nutrient limitation in the open ocean would be further enhanced. For a better understanding on how diatoms respond to nitrogen supply in the future ocean, we cultivated Thalassiosira punctigera at different levels of nitrate (from 1 to 100 mu molL(-1)). Results showed that the half-saturation value for growth rate (K-mu=3.06 mu molL(-1)) corroborates the values obtained from a size-dependent model (3.03 mu molL(-1)), suggesting that nutrient storage in this large diatom has equilibrated with the bulk medium added during culturing. Measured physiological parameters, including growth rate, cellular Chl a concentration, and photosynthesis, were all significantly reduced as the extent of nitrogen limitation increased. However, the responses of elemental composition did not vary linearly with respect to the different degrees of nitrate limitation. Specifically, the elemental ratios of C:N and Si:N all increased under moderate nitrate limitation (2-10 mu molL(-1)), but further decreased when nitrate became extremely limited (1 mu molL(-1)). The particulate organic nitrogen production rate was sensitive to nitrate limitation, showing a significant decrease when nitrate was below 10 mu molL(-1). However, particulate organic carbon production rate remained stable until nitrate was reduced to 2 mu molL(-1). The diverse responses of physiological processes and elemental ratios to various nitrate levels indicate the fact that there is a large uncertainty about the biogeochemical consequences of changes in the future ocean.","2018","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","135-143","","2","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000450567400001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, we lack understanding of how ecological interactions will be affected under ocean warming and acidification (OWA) conditions. We tested the antagonistic effects of three strains of the dinoflagellate HAB species Alexandrium catenella on three target species (the chlorophyte Tetraselmis sp., the cryptomonad Rhodomonas salina, and the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii) at various biomass ratios between species, at ambient (16 degrees C and 400 mu atm CO2) and OWA (20 degrees C and 2000 mu atm CO2) conditions. In these experiments the Alexandrium strains had been raised under OWA conditions for similar to 100 generations. All three non-HAB species increased their growth rate under OWA relative to ambient conditions. Growth rate inhibition was evident for R. salina and Tetraselmis sp. under OWA conditions, but not under ambient conditions. These negative effects were exacerbated at higher concentrations of Alexandrium relative to non-HAB species. By contrast, T. weissflogii showed positive growth in the presence of two strains of Alexandrium under ambient conditions, whereas growth was unaffected under OWA. Contrary to our expectations, A. catenella had a slight negative response in the presence of the diatom. These results demonstrate that Alexandrium exerts higher antagonistic effects under OWA compared to ambient conditions, and these effects are species-specific and density dependent. These negative effects may shift phytoplankton community composition under OWA conditions.","2024-04","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:001287989000001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transcriptomics results indicated that T. pseudonana altered the copper detoxification strategy under OA by decreasing copper uptake and enhancing copper-thiol complexation and copper efflux. Biochemical analysis further showed that the activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), and phytochelatin synthetase (PCS) were enhanced to mitigate oxidative damage of copper stress under elevated CO2.

This study quantifies the thermal performance curves (TPCs) of FTs in the cosmopolitan model diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana, to advance understanding of trade-offs between physiological (photoacclimation, carbon fixation, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate uptake) and morphological traits (cell volume and frustule silicification). We show that each FT has substantial phenotypic plasticity and exhibits a unique TPC, varying in both shape and thermal optimum, and diverging from the growth response. The TPC for growth was symmetric with a thermal optimum (T-opt) of 18 degrees C. In comparison, the TPC for primary productivity was warm-skewed with a T-opt around 21 degrees C, whereas frustule silicification decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Together, this suggests that the optimal temperature for overall fitness is a balance of trade-offs in the underlying functional traits. Moreover, these results demonstrate that growth is not necessarily an accurate estimate of overall biogeochemical performance and that temperature change will likely influence elemental fluxes such as carbon and silicon. Finally, we show that temperature-driven changes in individual traits e.g., photoacclimation, can mimic responses experienced under other environmental stressors (high light) and so a multi-trait assessment is essential for accurate interpretation of the cellular impact of warming. This study also reveals that multi-trait analysis, in the context of TPCs, provides insight into the cellular physiology regulating the whole cell response and has the potential to provide better estimates of how diatom-mediated biogeochemical fluxes are likely to be impacted in the context of ocean warming. Analyzing the response of multiple traits more comprehensively over other environmental gradients may therefore provide a useful framework to advance understanding of how taxon-specific functional traits will respond to multifaceted ocean change.","2016","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000457358000043","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first data about its occurrence in Hungary, in the southern Danube stretch, were published by Schmidt & Voros (1981). The presence of S. potamos was noted in Danube samples taken at the end of fifties near Budapest (Kiss, 1986). This species became abundant in the Hungarian stretch of River Danube at the end of sixties simultaneously with eutrophication. The main factors influencing the quantities of S. potamos populations are floods and temperature. The nutrient supply of the river is very high, therefore it cannot be a limiting factor. The effect of floods is a complex one. Increase in current velocity is not insignificant. Transparency influenced by the suspended matter content is important. In low water periods when suspended matter content is low (10-20 mg l(-1)), 70-90% of water column belongs to the euphotic zone. For this reason, low water periods favour increases in phytoplankton density. On the basis of this study, we conclude that S. potamos is a warm stenothermic species, with high light demand.

Although warmer conditions decreased the cell viability, the diatoms subjected to the synergistic effects of MPs and warming showed significant increases in the growth rate (1.10-fold) and nitrogen uptake rate (1.26-fold). Metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that MPs and warming mainly promoted fatty acid metabolism, the urea cycle, glutamine and glutamate pro-duction, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle due to an increased level of 2-oxoglutarate, which is the hub of carbon and nitrogen metabolism and accounts for the acquisition and utilization of carbon and nitrogen. Our findings emphasize the nonnegligible effects of MPs and HWs on the algal carbon and nitrogen cycles in waters.","2023-04-15","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","233","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000951477100001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, there is a significant decrease in the contribution of small diatom species (Skeletonema sp. and Chaetoceros socialis H.S.Lauder as well as coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) W.W.Hay and H.P.Mohler) to the total phytoplankton biomass in these waters. Previously these species caused regular weak blooms. In the warm periods (from May to October), during which the main phytoplankton biomass is formed, large diatom species Pseudosolenia calcar-avis (Schultze) B.G.Sundstrom, 1986, Proboscia alata (Brightwell) Sundstrom and dinoflagellates predominate. Therefore, the maximum values of the phytoplankton community's specific growth rate are about two times lower than in the preceding periods and do not exceed 1.10-1.40 day(-1). There was also a decrease observed in the microzooplankton grazing rate, which, during the year, was no higher than 0.70-1.20 day(-1). This is primarily conditioned by the increased role of large algae in phytoplankton, which means a decline in nutrition quality for microzooplankton. As a result of the joint influence of nutrition quality and water pollution, the relative share of net primary production consumed by microzooplankton in the warm periods of the year averaged only 32%, which is two times lower than the average values generally accepted for marine ecosystems. This means that the transfer of matter and energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels is significantly decreased.","2021-11","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","22","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000724793800001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The algae causing red tide and green tide often interact with each other in costal ecosystems. However, little is known on how future CO2-induced ocean acidification combined with temperature variation would affect the interaction of red and green tides. In this study, we cultured the red tide alga Skeletonema costatuum and the green tide alga Ulva linza under ambient (400 ppm) and future CO2 (1000 ppm) levels and three temperatures (12, 18, 24 degrees C) in both monoculture and coculture systems. Coculture did not affect the growth rate of U. linza but significantly decreased it for S. costatum. Elevated CO2 relieved the inhibitory effect of U. linza on the growth of S. costatum, particularly for higher temperatures. At elevated CO2, higher temperature increased the growth rate of S. costatum but reduced it for U. linza. Coculture with U. linza reduced the net photosynthetic rate of S. costatum, which was relieved by elevated CO2. This pattern was also found in Chl a content, indicating that U. linza may inhibit growth of S. costatum via harming pigment synthesis and thus photosynthesis. In monoculture, higher temperature did not affect respiration rate of S. costatum but increased it in U. linza. Coculture did not affect respiration of U. linza but stimulated it for S. costatum, which was a signal of responding to biotic and/abiotic stress. The increased growth of S. costatum at higher temperature and decreased inhibition of U. linza on S. costatum at elevated CO2 suggest that red tides may have more advantages over green tides in future warmer and CO2-enriched oceans.","2019-05","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000504780600001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While a variety of growth conditions influence the magnitude of H-2-depletion, the effect of salinity is of particular interest due to the paleohydrological applications of lipid H-2/H-1. In previous studies, lipid-water H-2/H-1 fractionation was shown to decrease as salinity increased, a response largely independent of lipid type, species, or setting. The mechanism responsible for this response remains uncertain, primarily because salinity is rarely isolated as the sole variable in laboratory cultivation experiments investigating hydrogen isotope systematics in microalgae. Here we report the lipid-water H-2/H-1 fractionation response to salinity in nutrient-replete continuous cultures of the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. In six cultures with the same growth rate at salinities between 14-40 ppt, lipid-water H-2/H-1 fractionation decreased linearly as salinity increased by 1.3%/ppt in fatty acids (C-14:0, C-16:0, C-16:1) and by 1.0%/ppt in the sterol 24-methyl-cholesta-5,24(28)-dien-3 beta-ol. A constant growth rate between cultures reveals that the fractionation response to salinity is independent of growth rate. Sensitivity tests using a simple hydrogen flux model indicated that at high salinity a greater proportion of metabolic NAD(P)H in lipids at the expense of photosynthetic NADPH can cause H-2-enrichment. Additionally, increased exudate release or decreased hydrogen transport can enrich both lipids and cell-water in H-2. The 1.0-1.3%/ppt increase in lipid-water H-2/H-1 fractionation observed in T. pseudonana is within the 0.8-2%/ppt range observed in field studies and culture studies, supporting the application of algal lipid 2H/1H as a paleosalinity proxy.

These processes may benefit from genome-scale models, which predict intracellular fluxes and theoretical yields, as well as the viability of knockout and knock-in transformants. Here we present a genome-scale metabolic model of a fully sequenced and transformable diatom: Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The metabolic network was constructed using the P. tricornutum genome, biochemical literature, and online bioinformatic databases. Intracellular fluxes in P. tricornutum were calculated for autotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions, as well as knockout conditions that explore the in silico role of glycolytic enzymes in the mitochondrion. The flux distribution for lower glycolysis in the mitochondrion depended on which transporters for TCA cycle metabolites were included in the model. The growth rate predictions were validated against experimental data obtained using chemostats. Two published studies on this organism were used to validate model predictions for cyclic electron flow under autotrophic conditions, and fluxes through the phosphoketolase, glycine and serine synthesis pathways under mixotrophic conditions. Several gaps in annotation were also identified. The model also explored unusual features of diatom metabolism, such as the presence of lower glycolysis pathways in the mitochondrion, as well as differences between P. tricornutum and other photosynthetic organisms.","2016-01","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","161-176","","1","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000368821500013","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elevated pCO(2) (and hence seawater acidification) under the nitrate-limited conditions led to decreases in specific growth rate, cell size, pigment content, photochemical quantum yield of PSII, and photosynthetic carbon fixation. Furthermore, increasing the temperature exacerbated the negative effects of the seawater acidification associated with elevated pCO(2) on specific growth rate and chlorophyll content under the N-limited conditions These results imply that a reduced upward transport of nutrients due to enhanced stratification associated with ocean warming might act synergistically to reduce growth and carbon fixation by diatoms under progressive ocean acidification, with important ramifications for ocean productivity and the strength of the biological CO2 pump.","2018-07","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","1451-1464","","4","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000439700800022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These key dominant species may undergo dramatic changes due to global climate change. Results: In order to identify molecular stress-indicators for the ubiquitous diatom species Skeletonema marinoi, we tested stress-related genes in different environmental conditions (i.e. nutrient starvation/depletion, CO2-enrichment and combined effects of these stressors) using RT-qPCR. The data show that these stressors impact algal growth rate, inducing early aging and profound changes in expression levels of the genes of interest. Conclusions: Most analyzed genes (e.g. antioxidant-related and aldehyde dehydrogenases) were strongly down-regulated which may indicate a strategy to avoid unnecessary over-investment in their respective proteins. By contrast, key genes were activated (e.g. HSPs, GOX) which may allow the diatom species to better cope with adverse conditions.

In unicellular phytoplankton, the net population growth rate is the difference between the cell division rate and the death rate. Along with predation and disease, phytoplankton mortality arises from abiotic stress. Although the effect of temperature on the net population growth rate is well understood, studies examining thermally induced death rates in phytoplankton are scarce. We investigated how cell division and death rates of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum varied within its thermal tolerance limits (thermal niche), and at temperatures just above its upper thermal tolerance limit. We show that death rates were largely independent of temperature when P. tricornutum was grown within its thermal niche, but increased significantly at temperatures that approached or exceeded its upper thermal tolerance limit. Furthermore, the sensitivity of mortality increased with the duration of exposure to heat stress and was affected by the pre-acclimation temperature. Heat waves can be expected to significantly affect phytoplankton mortality episodically. The increasing frequency of heat waves accompanying global warming can be expected to drive changes in phytoplankton community structure due to interspecific variability of thermal niches with potential implications for food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycles.","2021-10","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","5253-5261","","20","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000671619200001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of the most detected herbicides are triazine compounds, such as: simazine (SIM), terbuthylazine (TBA), its degradation product desethyl-terbuthylazine (D-TBA) and other herbicides, such as metolachlor (MET). In this paper, the sensitivity of the diatom Skeletonema marinoi to the most detected herbicides (TBA, D-TBA, SIM and MET) was preliminarily studied. All the pollutants tested significantly inhibited the diatom growth and photosynthetic efficiency (from the concentration of 15 mu g L-1) with the exception of TBA which had the strongest effects on S. marinoi starting from the concentration of 5 mu g L-1. Consequently, cellular physiological responses to TBA exposure (1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 mu g L-1) were further studied at increasing temperature conditions (15,20 and 25 degrees C). Inhibition of growth rate and photosynthetic efficiency was observed earlier and determined by lower TBA levels than those affecting cell growth. These responses were significantly enhanced at increasing temperature conditions when growth rates were higher than those measured at 15 degrees C. Carbon cell content increased in the cultures exposed to high concentrations of TBA (from 20 mu g L-1) compared to the controls, especially at high temperatures. Cell chlorophyll significantly increased from the added concentration of 10 mu g L-1 of TBA at all the temperatures and, as a consequence, also the Chl:C ratio significantly increased. The C:N ratio followed the pattern of nitrate uptake and was characterized, at all the temperatures, by low values during the lag phase in cultures with 20 and 30 mu g L-1 of TBA; in these conditions, in fact, the nutrient in the medium was exhausted later then in the controls. Only cultures exposed to 30 mu g L-1 of TBA at 25 degrees C, which stopped to take up nutrients earlier and could not increase chlorophyll levels, did not display any growth capacity. This study shows that S. marinoi is affected by TBA concentrations lower than those affecting some harmful flagellate species frequently observed in the Adriatic Sea. Thus, it raises the question of the combined effects of herbicides pollution and high temperature pressures on phytoplankton composition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study we compared the photophysiology of the Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros brevis at two pCO(2) extremes: 750 ppmv (2x ambient) and 190 ppmv (0.5x ambient) CO2. Cultures were acclimated to four irradiance regimes: two regimes simulating deep or shallow vertical mixing, and two regimes mimicking limiting and saturating stable water column conditions. Then, growth rate, pigmentation, RuBisCO large subunit expression. RuBisCO activity, photosynthesis vs irradiance curves, effective quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m), and POC were measured. The four irradiance regimes induced a suite of photophysiological responses, ranging from low light acclimation to efficient photoprotection. Growth was reduced under the low constant and the deep mixing regime, compared to the shallow mixing and the stable saturating regime. Low stable irradiance resulted in higher light harvesting pigment concentrations, lower RuBisCO activity and a lower light saturation point (E-k) compared to the other irradiance regimes. Highest RuBisCO activity as well as P-max levels was measured in the shallow mixing regime, which received the highest total daily light dose. Photoprotection by xanthophyll cycling was observed under all irradiance regimes except the low stable irradiance regime, and xanthophyll cycle pool sizes were higher under the dynamic irradiance regimes. For the fluctuating irradiance regimes. E-v/E-m was hardly affected by previous excess irradiance exposure, suggesting minimal PSII damage. No significant differences between the two pCO(2) levels were found, with respect to growth, pigment content and composition, photosynthesis, photoprotection and RuBisCO activity, for all four irradiance regimes.

It has thus gained interest in the context of climate change and several studies investigated the influence of elevated temperature and/or CO2 on DMSP in complex plankton communities. However, only little information about changes in response to these factors in single species is available. Therefore, we analyzed DMSP in different phytoplankton cultures (Thalassiosira pseudonana, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Emiliania huxleyi) under the influence of increased temperature by 6 degrees C and elevated CO2 to 790 ppmv. In addition, we addressed glycine betaine (GBT) that fulfills a similar function as osmolyte like DMSP. In all cultures GBT concentrations increased at higher temperature and decreased at elevated CO2. In contrast, diatoms and prymnesiophytes revealed opposite trends for DMSP.

The eurythermal diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii shows great resistance and robustness, and can be considered a suitable candidate for outdoor cultivation. In this study we investigated the resilience of one strain of this species during one-year outdoor experimentation in inclined tubular photobioreator with a working volume of 40 L. Cells of T. weissflogii overcome temperature and irradiance fluctuations by adapting their growth rate at the different environmental conditions. Calculation of areal biomass productivity based on 30 cultures along the year showed a median value of 3.83 gm(-2) day(-1) with maximal values of biomass (6.8 gm(-2) day(-1)) and lipids (1.2 gm(-2) day(-1)) reached in February and July, respectively. We observed a decline in biomass productivity with temperature increase, whereas lipid content (10-20% of dry biomass) was not significantly affected by the environmental conditions as far as a high concentration of nutrients was maintained. The outdoor experimentation successfully proved one year-round production of biomass from a single diatom species in closed photobioreactor, making T. weissflogii a suitable candidate for guaranteeing stable annual productive cycles in outdoor plant.","2019-09","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000478787200006","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explore the potential biotic consequences of climate change in these systems, we conducted paleo- and neoecological observational studies, as well as a short-term experiment to examine Daphnia responses to changing environmental conditions in Rocky Mountain alpine lakes. Our analysis of a sediment core from Emerald Lake representing two periods from the Holocene revealed a significant positive relationship between the abundance of Daphnia remains and fossil Aula-coseira lirata, a diatom associated with deeper mixing depths. In addition, we detected a significant increase in mean Daphnia density in the long-term record (1991-2005) from Pipit Lake, a trend that correlated well with increases in mean surface temperature. In our survey of Daphnia in 10 lakes in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Daphnia abundance was positively correlated with both dissolved organic carbon concentration and temperature. Finally, our short-term incubation experiment demonstrated significant effects of physical conditions (i.e., temperature and/or UV radiation) and water chemistry on the juvenile growth rate of Daphnia. Overall, our findings highlight the sensitivity of Daphnia to changes in mixing depth, water temperature, and dissolved organic matter, three limnological variables that are highly sensitive to changes not only in air temperature, but also to precipitation and location of the treeline in alpine catchments. Thus, we conclude that Daphnia abundance could serve as a powerful sentinel response to climate change in alpine lakes of the Rocky Mountains.","2011-11","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","263-277","","1","676","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000296739300017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increases in air and seawater temperatures, not matter how small, can alter coastal biological communities due to both temperature increases as well as salinity reduction from glacier melting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the individual and combined effects of elevated sea surface temperature (+ 4 degrees C) and decreased salinity (-4) on growth and assemblage composition of natural summer phytoplankton from Potter Cove (King George Island, South Shetlands, northern WAP), using an outdoor microcosm experiment. Pigment composition was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/Chemtax) and species composition by light and electron microscopy. Increases in phytoplankton biomass during the first 3 days at elevated-temperatures coincided with an increase in the abundance and the specific growth rate of small centric diatoms (Chaetoceros socialis and Shionodiscus gaarderae, mostly observed in temperate waters) and unidentified small phytoflagellates < 5 mu m. In contrast, pennate diatoms significantly decreased. At the end of the experiment on day 7, under nitrate and phosphate limitation, chlorophytes abundances increased under low salinity whereas prasinophytes decreased in all treatments. This study suggests that climate change could notably affect Antarctic phytoplankton composition by favouring temperate-water species previously undetected in Antarctic waters, such us S. gaarderae. Moreover, the observed changes in phytoplankton structure, associated with an increase of nano- over micro-size taxa, could have important implications for future Antarctic food webs.","2020-11","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31","","","","","532","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000588286400004","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These in turn are expected to affect the physiological performance of phytoplankton. In order to learn how phytoplankton respond to the predicted scenario of increased CO2 and decreased nitrogen in the surface mixed layer, we investigated the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model organism. The cells were cultured in both low CO2 (390 mu atm) and high CO2 (1000 mu atm) conditions at limiting (10 mu mol L-1) or enriched (110 mu mol L-1) nitrate concentrations. Our study shows that nitrogen limitation resulted in significant decreases in cell size, pigmentation, growth rate and effective quantum yield of Phaeodactylum tricornutum, but these parameters were not affected by enhanced dissolved CO2 and lowered pH. However, increased CO2 concentration induced higher rETR(max) and higher dark respiration rates and decreased the CO2 or dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) affinity for electron transfer (shown by higher values for K-1/2 DIC or K-1/2 CO2). Furthermore, the elemental stoichiometry (carbon to nitrogen ratio) was raised under high CO2 conditions in both nitrogen limited and nitrogen replete conditions, with the ratio in the high CO2 and low nitrate grown cells being higher by 45% compared to that in the low CO2 and nitrate replete grown ones. Our results suggest that while nitrogen limitation had a greater effect than ocean acidification, the combined effects of both factors could act synergistically to affect marine diatoms and related biogeochemical cycles in future oceans.","2012-12-07","2025-03-12 17:12:32","2025-03-12 17:12:32","","","","12","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000312064100133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, warming can trigger blooms of toxic algae, yet we do not know how extreme warming such as a marine heatwave (MHW) and algal toxins may affect marine aquaculture species. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of a simulated MHW in combination with exposure to trans-4-trans-decadienal (PUA), a diatom-derived toxin, on survival, growth, development and biochemical composition of cobia larvae and juveniles. Cobia larvae were exposed for 48 hr to one of two temperatures (29 vs. 34 degrees C) and two PUA treatments (0 vs. 0.5 mu M). Surviving larvae from each treatment were divided into two subsets: three replicates were used for the feeding test and five replicates were used for the recovery test in a non-contaminated environment at the respective temperatures of 29 or 34 degrees C. Survival of cobia larvae was reduced by 16% in either MHW or PUA, but it dropped by 60% when both stressors were present, indicating a synergistic effect. MHW, but not PUA, reduced the feeding of cobia larvae. PUA had no delayed effects on growth rate and biochemical composition of the fish. MHW strongly reduced specific growth rate, body protein and lipid contents in cobia. Our results provide the first empirical evidence of how MHW and toxic algae may interact and challenge cobia and marine aquaculture production in tropical countries.","2020-06","2025-03-12 17:12:32","2025-03-12 17:12:32","","2535-2544","","6","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000531692000034","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biomass of phytoplankton at both stations were enhanced by HT. HTHC did not affect phytoplankton biomass at station D001 but decreased it at station SEATS. HT alone increased net primary productivity by 234% at station SEATS and by 67% at station D001 but the stimulating effect disappeared when HC was combined. HT also increased respiration rate by 236% at station SEATS and by 87% at station D001 whereas HTHC reduced it by 61% at station SEATS and did not affect it at station D001. Overall, our findings indicate that the positive effect of ocean warming on phytoplankton assemblages in NSCS could be damped or offset by ocean acidification. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These pH changes affect phytoplankton growth and composition. Diatom cells constitute almost 50% of phytoplankton, and they have significant importance in the ocean food chains and biotechnology industries. Therefore, knowledge of their response to pH changes could be useful for conservation and aquaculture of these species. There are different pH-Stat systems to supply CO2 gas to the culture medium, however, it is common to use one unit or pH probe for each culture. In this study, we designed a low-cost pH-stat to regulate the pH level in fifteen simultaneous cultures. It was evaluated with Phaeodactylum tricornutum at three pH setpoints:7.5 and 7.8 as acid treatments and 8.1 as control; each experiment lasted seven days, and growth rates, latency phases and nutrient consumption rates were determined. The accuracy and precision of the pH regulated was in an acceptable level compared with other systems. The growth rate and consumption of nitrate were higher at pH 8.1, moreover differences were observed in the duration of the latency phase, suggesting a longer acclimation process at lower pH. Changes in phosphate and iron consumption indicated a higher availability in acid treatments, however they did not enhance the growth. These denoted unfavorable effects of ocean acidification on diatoms growth.","2022-11","2025-03-12 17:12:32","2025-03-12 17:12:32","","","","","99","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000891845800001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
