Here, we investigated how the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (BOF 92, a non-calcifying strain) responded to changes in temperature in short- and long-term thermal treatments. The specific growth rate after 10 days of acclimation increased gradually with increasing temperatures (14, 17, 21, 24, 28 degrees C) and peaked at similar to 23 degrees C, followed by a significant decrease to 28 degrees C. Chlorophyll a content, cell size, photosynthetic rate, and respiratory rate increased significantly from 14 degrees C to 24 degrees C, but the cellular particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) showed the lowest values at the optimal temperature. In contrast, during long-term thermal treatments at 17 degrees C and 21 degrees C for 656 days (similar to 790 generations for 17 degrees C treatment; similar to 830 generations for 21 degrees C treatment), the warming significantly stimulated the growth in the first 34 days and the last 162 days, but there was no significant difference in specific growth rate from Day 35 to Day 493. Chlorophyll a content, cell size, cellular POC/PON, and the ratio of POC to PON, showed no significant difference between the warming and control for most of the duration of the long-term exposure. The warming-selected population did not acquire persistent traits in terms of growth and cell quotas of POC and PON, which resumed to the levels in the control temperature treatment after about 9 generations in the shift test. In summary, our results indicate that warming by 4 degrees C (17 degrees C and 21 degrees C) enhanced the growth, but did not result in adaptative changes in E. huxleyi (BOF 92) over a growth period of about 800 generations, reflecting that mild or non-stressful warming treatment to E. huxleyi isolated from cold seas does not alter its phenotypic plasticity.","2023-06-26","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001022463300001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","WWQT2HGI"

Here, using transcriptomics, miRNAomics, and physiological measurements, we report that phosphorus (P)-limitation increased cellular carbon and calcium contents and sinking rate of the cosmopolitan phytoplankton Emiliania huxleyi. Under P-limitation, when photosynthesis was depressed, there were substantial increases in cellular organic (3.4-fold) and inorganic (fivefold) carbon contents due to cell division arrest and, as our transcriptomic data suggest, CO2 incorporation into C4 compounds. Furthermore, calcification was increased by 46% through transcriptional and epigenetic regulations. An increase in sinking rate by 37-44% was detected. Although calcification releases equivalent amounts of CO2, the considerable increase in cellular carbon content and sinking rate far outweighed the CO2 release, leading to an elevated efficiency of carbon export by E. huxleyi, which would partially offset the decrease in BP capacity resulting from lower growth rate under P deficiency. However, how the observed sinking rate and its increase under P limitation on the laboratory cultures will translate into BP efficiency still requires further examination using in situ or mesocosm experiments.","2022-05-23","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000807108800001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","SW46J2ZA"

Both light and temperature affected growth rate and cell size in batch cultures, but the concentration of DMSP in the cells was dependent on temperature only: at low temperature DMSP accumulated. This physiological response, assumed to be characteristic of DMSP-producing microalgae in general, is in line with the correlation that has been found between elevated concentrations of the DMS oxidation product MSA in ice core slices corresponding with low sea surface temperatures.

Specifically, decreased growth rate of E. huxleyi at enhanced CO2 concentrations was amplified in the bloom phase (potentially also related to nutrient concentrations) and with the coexistence with Idiomarina abyssalis (I. abyssalis) and Brachybacterium sp. In addition, enhanced CO2 concentrations also affected E. huxleyi's cellular content estimates, increasing organic and decreasing inorganic carbon, in the presence of I. abyssalis, but not Brachybacterium sp. At the same time, the bacterial isolates only survived in coexistence with E. huxleyi, but exclusively I. abyssalis at present CO2 concentrations.

Calcite carbon and organic carbon content of the cells as well as instantaneous growth rate, cell size, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light-scatter properties clearly depended on growth conditions and differed considerably for the two morphotypes. The ratio between calcite carbon and organic carbon production showed an optimum of 0.65 in E. huxleyi type A cells at PFD = 17.5. The ratio increased slightly with a temperature increase from 10-degrees to 15-degrees-C but remained < 1.0 at both temperatures in light-limited cells. In contrast, calcite carbon production exceeded organic carbon production (ratio: 1.4-2.2) in phosphate-deprived cultures. Emiliania huxleyi type B generally showed a higher calcite carbon/organic carbon ratio than E. huxleyi type A, but the relation with PFD was similar. The content Of calcite carbon and organic carbon as well as the instantaneous growth rate, cell size, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light-scatter properties showed large diel variations that were closely related to the division cycle. Our results show the importance of mapping the structure of any sampled cell population with respect to the phase in the cell division cycle, as this largely determines the outcome of not only ''per cell'' measurements but also short time (less than 24 h)flux measurements. For instance, dark production of calcite by E. huxleyi was negatively affected by cell division. Slowly growing (phosphate-stressed) cultures produced calcite in the light and in the dark. In contrast, rapidly growing cultures at 10-degrees-C produced calcite only in the light, whereas in the dark there was a significant loss of calcite due to dissolution.","1994-04","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"230-241",NA,"2",30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1994NK49000010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","33IQU52I"

Cellular DMSP increased with increasing salinity, compatible with the hypothesis that DMSP is a compatible osmolyte. Cellular DMSP content was highest at colder temperatures and decreased as temperature increased. Net DMSP production rate also depended on cell size and growth rate was greatest about 2 degrees C below the optimum growth temperature of 20 degrees C for this clone. This resulted in a unimodal response of net DMSP production to increasing temperature: net DMSP production increased with increasing temperature when the cells were growing at temperatures below optimum for growth. At and above optimum growth temperature, further warming decreased net DMSP production. For the effect of temperature alone, in the subtropical oceans, where G. oceanica is growing at or above its optimum, further warming due to climate change will result in decreased net DMSP production and so a probable decrease in the flux of DMS to the atmosphere and sulphate aerosol production. Inasmuch as these aerosols modulate cloud albedo and longevity then these too will both decrease, resulting in a positive feedback response for temperature. The reverse effect may occur in higher latitude oceans where growth temperature is below optimum. The exact response in both regions is complicated because warming will also enhance water column stratification and may reduce mixed layer depths, affecting both nutrient and light regimes, as well as possible species succession effects. Further work is required to investigate these other indirect temperature effects.","2023-03-04","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"152-163",NA,"2",62,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000941199400001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","K27QKAMY"

We tested the hypothesis that increasing phosphorus limitation, resulting from ocean warming, will affect coccolithophores and change their contribution to the PIC:POC ratios. Four strains were isolated in the oligotrophic Algerian basin (western Mediterranean), and two strains in the extremely oligotrophic and often phosphorus depleted Levantine basin (eastern Mediterranean). Samples for particulate inorganic carbon, PIC; particulate organic carbon, POC; particulate organic phosphorus, POP; and total particulate nitrogen, TPN, were taken at equal cell densities in phosphorus limited and control culture conditions (harvesting in exponential and stationary phases respectively). Different morphological features of coccoliths were analyzed. Phosphorus limitation was inferred from: 1. a decrease in growth rate between 22% and 34% compared to phosphorus replete cultures; 2. a reduction in final cell density from ca. 2 x 10(6) cells/ml to ca. 8 x 10(4) cells/ml, and 3. markedly lower POP quotas of the limited cells. Differences in the phosphate uptake machinery are suggested based on the fact that three western Mediterranean strains decreased the phosphate concentration in the culture media until the detection limit in the first 3 experimental days while 4-5 days were necessary for the other strains. Cellular carbon quotas increased in all strains under phosphorus limitation in comparison to their respective control cultures. The increase in POC quotas ranged between 179% and 260% and in PIC quotas between 43% and 201%. TPN quotas increased under phosphorus limitation between 31% and 86% in five out of six strains. POC:TPN increased in all strains, which suggests a change in the molecular composition of the cells when exposed to phosphorus limitation. Strain specific responses were also observed in the PIC:POC ratio, which decreased in five strains and did not change in another. Phosphorus limitation did not lead to malformations. However, morphological changes of coccoliths occurred, also in a strain specific way, namely the percentage of over-calcified coccoliths was altered by P limitation, but we observed all signs in the responses among different strains. Nevertheless, this morphological feature does not reflect the changes in calcite production (PICp nor PIC:POC). Strain specific responses were not related to the isolation location, suggesting that the isolated western and eastern strains do not represent distinct eco-genotypes featuring different phosphorus usage strategies.

However, the application of miRNA signatures as diagnostic markers in marine viral infection has made limited progress. Based on our previous small-RNA sequencing data, one host miRNA biomarker that is upregulated in early infection and seven viral miRNA biomarkers that are upregulated in late infection were identified and verified using qRT-PCR and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in pure culture, mixed culture, and natural seawater culture. The host ehx-miR20-5p was able to significantly differentiate infection groups from the control in the middle (24 h post-infection, hpi) and late infection (48 hpi) phases, while seven virus-derived miRNA biomarkers could diagnose the early and late stages of EhV infection. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these miRNAs participated in numerous essential metabolic pathways, including gene transcription and translation, cell division-related pathways, protein-degradation-related processes, and lipid metabolism. Additionally, a dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the targeted relationship between a viral ehv-miR7-5p and the host dihydroceramide desaturase gene (hDCD). This finding suggests that the virus-derived miRNA has the ability to inhibit the host sphingolipid metabolism, which is a specific characteristic of EhV infection during the late stage.

Reduced phosphorus availability, elevated pCO(2) concentrations, and increasing light intensity act synergistically to increase the allocation of POC to carbohydrates. Under elevated pCO(2) concentrations and increasing light intensity, enhanced carbon fixation could increase carbon storage in the phosphorus-limited regions of the oceans where E. huxleyi dominates the phytoplankton assemblages. In each type of light intensity, elemental-carbonto-phosphorus (C : P) and nitrogen-to-phosphorus (N : P) ratios decrease with increasing growth rate.

Organisms with generation times from years to decades have the capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions over a few generations by selecting from existing genotypes/phenotypes, but it is unlikely that evolution through mutation will be a major factor for organisms with generation times of years to decades. However, phytoplankton and other microbes, with generation times of days or less, experience hundreds of generations each year, allowing the possibility for favorable mutations (i.e., those that produce organisms with fitness maxima nearer to the environmental conditions at that time) to dominate existing genotypes and survive in a changing climate. Several laboratories have grown phytoplankton cultures for hundreds to thousands of generations and demonstrated that they have changed genetic makeup. In particular Schluter et al. (2014) grew replicates derived from a single cell of Emiliania huxleyi, a coccolithophorid with broad geographical and thermal range, for 3 years (similar to 1250 generations) at 15 degrees C, and then for a year at 26.3 degrees C, near their upper thermal limit. During the last year the intrinsic growth rate increased more or less linearly, which the authors attribute to genetic mutation. Here we simulate genetic mutation of a single trait (intrinsic growth rate), both for the control phase and the warm phase of their study. We consider sensitivities to frequency of mutation, changes with temperature in intrinsic growth rate, and use the experimental setup and results to place constraints on the way mutations occur. In particular, all numerical experiments with mutation result in a lag time similar to 30-140 generations before a significant increase in realized growth rate occurs. This lag after a favorable mutation results from the number of generations required for a single favorable mutant cell to reach a significant fraction of the similar to 10(5 )cells in the culture. A numerical experiment that includes a simple plastic response formulation shows that plasticity could remove this lag and yield results more in agreement with those observed in the laboratory study.","2017","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"",3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457690200012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

The calcification response to temperature changes reported in the literature, however, is ambiguous. The two main sources of this ambiguity are putatively differences in experimental setup and strain specificity. In this study we therefore compare three strains isolated in the North Pacific under identical experimental conditions. Three strains of Emiliania huxleyi type A were grown under non-limiting nutrient and light conditions, at 10, 15, 20 and 25aEuro-A degrees C. All three strains displayed similar growth rate versus temperature relationships, with an optimum at 20-25aEuro-A degrees C. Elemental production (particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), particulate organic carbon (POC), total particulate nitrogen (TPN)), coccolith mass, coccolith size, and width of the tube element cycle were positively correlated with temperature over the sub-optimum to optimum temperature range. The correlation between PIC production and coccolith mass/size supports the notion that coccolith mass can be used as a proxy for PIC production in sediment samples. Increasing PIC production was significantly positively correlated with the percentage of incomplete coccoliths in one strain only. Generally, coccoliths were heavier when PIC production was higher. This shows that incompleteness of coccoliths is not due to time shortage at high PIC production. Sub-optimal growth temperatures lead to an increase in the percentage of malformed coccoliths in a strain-specific fashion. Since in total only six strains have been tested thus far, it is presently difficult to say whether sub-optimal temperature is an important factor causing malformations in the field. The most important parameter in biogeochemical terms, the PICaEuro-:aEuro-POC ratio, shows a minimum at optimum growth temperature in all investigated strains. This clarifies the ambiguous picture featuring in the literature, i.e. discrepancies between PICaEuro-:aEuro-POC-temperature relationships reported in different studies using different strains and different experimental setups. In summary, global warming might cause a decline in coccolithophore's PIC contribution to the rain ratio, as well as improved fitness in some genotypes due to fewer coccolith malformations.","2016","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"2913-2926",NA,"10",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000378354900004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Previous studies have established that bulk calcification scales with cell division rates under a wide range of pH conditions. Yet the fine-scale ultrastructural changes of the coccoliths and therefore the pH-sensitive underlying mechanisms altering biomineralization of the coccoliths remain largely underconstrained. Using circularly polarized light and high-resolution microscopy, we have generated mass estimates of cultured Gephyrocapsa oceanica coccoliths grown in media with pH values ranging from 7.4 to 9.0. These mass estimates representing a bulk calcification response were related to the morphological changes within the coccoliths. From optimal (pH8.6) down to pH7.4 conditions, we have observed that impaired cell growth and lower calcite quota are accompanied by a 35% decrease in mean coccolith mass. The data further show that seawater acidification does not homogenously affect calcification of the coccoliths, as a clear decrease of the breadth of the tube (a structure surrounding the central area of the coccoliths) was detected, whereas all other ultrastructural components were far less impacted. We discuss this specific sensitivity to acidification as the possible consequence of the altered interaction of the acidic polysaccharides used for biomineralization and ambient concentration of protons released by calcification that substantially modify the growth patterns, the morphology, and ultimately the mass of the coccoliths. Anthropogenic rise in CO2 concentrations induces ocean acidification, which represents a threat for marine organisms. As calcium carbonate is sensitive to pH, those organisms secreting calcite shells, such as the coccolithophores (unicellular microalgae), are particularly exposed to ongoing climate change. Previous studies have documented that the coccoliths, the calcite biominerals produced intracellularly by the coccolithophores, will be adversely affected by decreased ambient pH values. Yet how this reduction operates at the scale of the coccolith remains elusive and we are thus lacking an understanding of the intracellular mechanisms behind undercalcification, which is essential to anticipate the response of marine calcifiers in a changing planet. We analyzed the morphometric parameters of coccoliths grown under the pH range 7.4-9.0. Our data show a clear reduction in coccolith mass in more acidic conditions, and we explain this change by altered growth of calcite at an early stage of the formation of the biomineral. This study suggests that certain organic molecules used to promote intracellular calcification are perturbed by decreased local pH and that less calcified coccoliths produced within the cell cannot be the result of a postmortem process that may occur when calcite is bathed in relative low-pH environments after their secretion outside the cells.","2018-09","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"2761-2774",NA,"9",123,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000447644800008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Under the indoor constant light regime, the specific growth rate () was highest, while fluctuating outdoor solar radiation significantly decreased the growth rate.

Addition of UVR increased both the repair rate and intracellular UV-absorbing compounds.

Elevated temperature and thermal variation decreased growth, calcification and physiological rates, both individually and interactively. The 1 d thermal variation frequencies were less inhibitory than 2 d variations under high temperatures, indicating that high-frequency thermal fluctuations may reduce heat-induced mortality and mitigate some impacts of extreme high-temperature events.

The negative effects of thermal variation on E. huxleyi growth rate and physiology are especially pronounced at high temperatures.

A total of 154 studies consisting 301 experiments were synthesized in this study. Under a projected temperature increase of 3-5 degrees C by IPCC AR6 at the end of this century, our results suggest that the growth and photosynthetic rate of coccolithophores were significantly enhanced by the rising temperature, while the calcification of coccolithophores was only slightly promoted. Warming also had significantly positive effects on the growth but not photosynthesis of diatoms. In comparison, the effect size of warming on the growth rate of coccolithophores was larger than that of diatoms. However, there was no significant effect of warming on either the ratio of particulate inorganic carbon to par-ticulate organic carbon (PIC:POC) of coccolithophores or the ratio of biogenic silica to carbon (BSi:C) of diatoms. Furthermore, the results reveal latitudinal and size-specific patterns of the effect sizes of warming. For diatoms, the effects of warming on growth were more prominent in high latitudes, specifically for the Southern Hemi-sphere species. In addition, the effect size of warming on the small-sized diatoms was larger than that of the large-sized diatoms. For coccolithophores, the growth of the Southern Hemisphere temperate strains was significantly promoted by warming. Overall, the results based on the meta-analysis indicate that the projected warming of the end of this century will be more favor to the growth of coccolithophores than that of diatoms, thus potentially affect the competitive advantages of coccolithophores over diatoms; while the mid-to high latitude species/strains of both coccolithophores and diatoms will benefit more than their counterparts in the lower latitudes.

Alkenones were detected in surface waters between 57degreesN and 63degreesN, where phosphate concentrations were low and the ammonium/nitrate ratio was high. The total alkenone content (C-37:2, C-37:3, and C-37:4) ranged from 22.0 to 349 mug g(-1) in suspended particles and from 0.109 to 1.42 mug 9 1 in surface sediments. This suggests that a large proportion of the particulate alkenones synthesized in the surface water rapidly degraded within the water column and/or at the water-sediment interface of the Bering Shelf. The change in the stable carbon isotopic composition (delta(13)C) of C-37:3 alkenone could not be explained only by variation in [CO2(aq)] in the surface water but also depended on the growth rate of E. huxleyi. The alkenone unsaturation index (U-37(K')) was converted into an alkenone ""temperature"" with three equations (Prahl et al., 1988; Sikes et al., 1997; Miiller et al., 1998); Sikes et al.'s (1997) equation gave the best correlation with the observed sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern Bering Sea. However, some temperatures estimated by Sikes et al.'s (1997) equation from the U-37(K') varied from the observed SST, possibly because of the rapidly changing rate of alkenone synthesis in the logarithmic growth stage or the low rate of alkenone synthesis when nutrients were limiting. Temperatures estimated from U-37(K') in the surface sediments (6.8 - 8.2degreesC) matched the observed SST in September (7-8degreesC) but differed from the annual average SST of 4 to 5degreesC, suggesting that most of the alkenone in the eastern Bering Sea was synthesized during limited periods, for instance, in September. The relative amounts of C-37:3 alkenone as proportions of the total alkenones (referred to as C-37:4%) were high, ranging from 18.3 to 41.4%. Low-salinity water (<32 psu) within the study area would have contributed to the high C-37:4% because a negative linear relationship between C-37:4% and salinity was found in this study.

There have been multiple attempts to project the responses of coccolithophores to changes in carbonate chemistry, but the interaction with light and temperature remains elusive. Here we devise a simple conceptual model to derive a fit equation for coccolithophorid growth, photosynthetic and calcification rates in response to simultaneous changes in carbonate chemistry, temperature and light conditions. The fit equation is able to account for up to 88% of the variability in measured metabolic rates. Equation projections indicate that temperature, light and carbonate chemistry all have different modulating effects on both optimal growth conditions and the sensitivity of responses to extreme environmental conditions. Calculations suggest that a single extreme environmental condition (CO2, temperature, light) will reduce maximum rates regardless of how optimal the other environmental conditions may be. Thus, while the response of coccolithophores to ocean change depends on multiple variables, the one which is least optimal will have the most impact on overall rates. Finally, responses to ocean change are usually reported in terms of cellular rates. However, changes in cellular rates can be a poor predictor for assessing changes in production at the community level. We therefore introduce a new metric, the calcium carbonate production potential (CCPP), which combines the independent effects of changes in growth rate and cellular calcium carbonate content to assess how environmental changes will impact coccolith production. Direct comparison of CO2 impacts on cellular CaCO3 production rates and CCPP shows that while the former is still at 45% of its pre-industrial capacity at 1,000 mu atm, the latter is reduced to 10%.","2018-01-04","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000456914800001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Taken together, we demonstrate that several attributes of thermal reaction norms in phytoplankton may change faster than the predicted progression of ocean warming.","2016-10","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"1156-1164",NA,"9",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000387763200011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Coccolithophores are vulnerable to ocean acidification and warming, therefore it is critical to establish the effects of climate change on these significant marine primary producers, and determine potential consequences that these changes can have on their consumers. Here, we quantified the impact of changes in pH and temperature on the nutritional condition (lipid content, particulate organic carbon/nitrogen), growth rate, and morphology of the most abundant living coccolithophore species, Emiliania huxleyi. We used a regression type approach with nine pH levels (ranging from 7.66 to 8.44) and two temperatures (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C). Lipid production was greater under reduced pH, and growth rates were distinctly lower at 15 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. The production potential of lipids, which estimates the availability of lipids to consumers, increased under 20 degrees C, but decreased under low pH. The results indicate that, while consumers will benefit energetically under ocean warming, this benefit will be mitigated by ocean acidification. The carbon to nitrogen ratio was higher at 20 degrees C and low pH, indicating that the nutritional quality of coccolithophores for consumers will decline under climate change. The impact of low pH on the structural integrity of the coccosphere may also mean that coccolithophores are easier to digest for consumers. Many responses suggest cellular stress, indicating that increases in temperature and reductions in pH may have a negative impact on the ecophysiology of coccolithophores.","2022-10","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"2309-2324",NA,"10",67,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000846459400001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

For identical temperature and media composition, Sr partitioning varies by more than 30% in exponential phase cultures of the five species and is linearly related to rates of calcite production/cell (rho=0.91). Exponential phase culture experiments with three strains of C leptoporus and six strains of G. oceanica at varying temperatures show variations in Sr partitioning of 20% and 30%, respectively. With C leptoporus, Sr partitioning is equally correlated with temperature and calcification rate (rho=0.8), which themselves are highly correlated; the slope of the relationship between D-Sr and calcification rate is comparable to that observed in all species at constant temperature. However, in G. oceanica, increased temperature appears to enhance Sr incorporation by up to 2% to 1.6% degreesC(-1) in the range of 15 to 30 degreesC. The strong influence of calcification rate on Sr partitioning may be useful for inferring past variations in coccolithophorid productivity from Sr partitioning in coccolith sediments if the influence of temperature on Sr partitioning can be resolved. Because the relationship between calcite production and Sr partitioning is linear, a proportional change in calcification should be expressed much more strongly in the Sr/Ca ratio of large species with rapid calcite production than in smaller species, which produce calcite more slowly. Consequently, it may be possible to separate temperature and calcification influences on coccolith Sr/Ca by separately analyzing Sr/Ca in species that produce calcite rapidly and those that produce calcite slowly, if both undergo comparable relative changes in calcification rates.

Currently, there is a significant decrease in the contribution of small diatom species (Skeletonema sp. and Chaetoceros socialis H.S.Lauder as well as coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) W.W.Hay and H.P.Mohler) to the total phytoplankton biomass in these waters. Previously these species caused regular weak blooms. In the warm periods (from May to October), during which the main phytoplankton biomass is formed, large diatom species Pseudosolenia calcar-avis (Schultze) B.G.Sundstrom, 1986, Proboscia alata (Brightwell) Sundstrom and dinoflagellates predominate. Therefore, the maximum values of the phytoplankton community's specific growth rate are about two times lower than in the preceding periods and do not exceed 1.10-1.40 day(-1). There was also a decrease observed in the microzooplankton grazing rate, which, during the year, was no higher than 0.70-1.20 day(-1). This is primarily conditioned by the increased role of large algae in phytoplankton, which means a decline in nutrition quality for microzooplankton. As a result of the joint influence of nutrition quality and water pollution, the relative share of net primary production consumed by microzooplankton in the warm periods of the year averaged only 32%, which is two times lower than the average values generally accepted for marine ecosystems. This means that the transfer of matter and energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels is significantly decreased.","2021-11","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"22",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000724793800001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

The nutricline is found at greater depths in warm, tropical waters, whereas more vigorous surface mixing in higher latitudes (seasonally) enhances nutrient availability and primary productivity. Ocean temperatures were similar to 7 degrees C higher during the middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO; similar to 16.9-14.7 million years ago, Ma), which was followed by Antarctic glaciation and global cooling during the middle Miocene Climate transition (MMCT; 14.7-13.8 Ma). Four decades ago, Haq (1980, ) already related migration patterns of low-latitude versus high-latitude calcareous nannoplankton in the Atlantic Ocean to major climatic fluctuations during the Miocene. Here, we detail and discuss the macroevolutionary patterns and processes across the middle Miocene (similar to 16.5-11 Ma) at five deep sea sites on a north-south transect in the Atlantic Ocean (57 degrees N to 28 degrees S). We show that the major cooling step toward the modern ""icehouse"" world impacted coccolithophore communities at all latitudes. Contrary to previous observations suggesting that tropical sites showed little change and that midlatitudes were the most sensitive recorders of climate change across the MMCT, we show that all sites recorded a marked diversification and increase in abundance of reticulofenestrids. Global cooling and related increased meridional overturning circulation are implicated as likely forcings for this macroevolutionary step toward establishing modern coccolithophore communities that are dominated by eurythermal and eurytrophic species such asEmiliania huxleyi. Plain Language Summary How will marine plankton communities respond to a much warmer world than today? How fast or slow would such changes be? We can learn valuable lessons from the fossil record of coccolithophores that represent a prominent phytoplankton group in both past and modern oceans. Changes in the composition of fossil assemblages show that species tracked past climate change on submillion year scales in the Atlantic Ocean. When ocean temperatures were similar to 7 degrees C warmer during the middle Miocene (similar to 16 million years ago), tropical species reached into the midlatitudes (42 degrees N) of the North Atlantic. When the Antarctic ice sheet grew larger and the oceans cooled after similar to 14.7 million years ago, a group known as the reticulofenestrids diversified and became the most common everywhere, also in the tropics. Apparently, this group maintained high fitness in an ""icehouse"" world with greater latitudinal temperature contrasts, more vigorous ocean circulation, and higher nutrient availability in the photic zone. Indeed, their cosmopolitan distribution implies broad temperature and other environmental tolerances, similar to the group's latest descendant, the modern species Emiliania huxleyi that also displays a wide genetic and ecophenotypic diversity.","2020-08","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"8",35,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000567508700002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Laboratory studies indicate a positive effect of rising CO2 on phytoplankton growth until an optimum is reached, after which the negative impact of accompanying acidification dominates. Here, we implemented carbonate system sensitivities of phytoplankton growth into our global biogeochemical model FESOM-REcoM and accounted explicitly for coccolithophores as the group most sensitive to CO2. In idealized simulations in which solely the atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio was modified, changes in competitive fitness and biomass are not only caused by the direct effects of CO2, but also by indirect effects via nutrient and light limitation as well as grazing. These cascading effects can both amplify or dampen phytoplankton responses to changing ocean pCO(2) levels. For example, coccolithophore growth is negatively affected both directly by future pCO(2) and indirectly by changes in light limitation, but these effects are compensated by a weakened nutrient limitation resulting from the decrease in small-phytoplankton biomass. In the Southern Ocean, future pCO(2) decreases small-phytoplankton biomass and hereby the preferred prey of zooplankton, which reduces the grazing pressure on diatoms and allows them to proliferate more strongly. In simulations that encompass CO2-driven warming and acidification, our model reveals that recent observed changes in North Atlantic coccolithophore biomass are driven primarily by warming and not by CO2. Our results highlight that CO2 can change the effects of other environmental drivers on phytoplankton growth, and that cascading effects may play an important role in projections of future net primary production.","2022-09-16","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"1",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000870833700001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

The energetic constraints associated with adaptation in phytoplankton are not yet understood, but are central to forecasting how global biogeochemical cycles respond to contemporary ocean change. Here, we demonstrate a number of potential trade-offs associated with high-temperature adaptation in a tropical microbial eukaryote, Amphidinium massartii (dinoflagellate). Most notably, the population became high-temperature specialized (higher fitness within a narrower thermal envelope and higher thermal optimum), and had a greater nutrient requirement for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Evidently, the energetic constraints associated with living at elevated temperature alter competiveness along other environmental gradients. While high-temperature adaptation led to an irreversible change in biochemical composition (i.e., an increase in fatty acid saturation), the mechanisms underpinning thermal evolution in phytoplankton remain unclear, and will be crucial to understanding whether the trade-offs observed here are species-specific or are representative of the evolutionary constraints in all phytoplankton.","2018-12","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"799-810",NA,"6",54,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000454908500005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Phytoplankton metabolic rates increase with temperature when nutrients are abundant, but it is unknown if the same pattern applies under nutrient-limited growth conditions, which prevail over most of the ocean. Here we use continuous cultures of three cosmopolitan and biogeochemically relevant species (Synechococcus sp., Skeletonema costatum and Emiliania huxleyi) to determine the temperature dependence (activation energy, Ea) of metabolism under different degrees of nitrogen (N) limitation. We show that both CO2 fixation and respiration rates increase with N supply but are largely insensitive to temperature. Ea of photosynthesis (0.11 +/- 0.06 eV, mean +/- SE) and respiration (0.04 +/- 0.17 eV) under N-limited growth is significantly smaller than Ea of growth rate under nutrient-replete conditions (0.77 +/- 0.06 eV). The reduced temperature dependence of metabolic rates under nutrient limitation can be explained in terms of enzyme kinetics, because both maximum reaction rates and halfsaturation constants increase with temperature.

The size of their coccosphere varies in the ocean along gradients of environmental conditions and provides a key for understanding the fate of this important phytoplankton group in the future ocean. But interpreting field changes in coccosphere size in terms of laboratory observations is hard, mainly because the marine signal reflects the response of multiple morphotypes to changes in a combination of environmental variables. In this paper I examine the large corpus of published laboratory experiments with coccolithophores looking for relations between environmental conditions, metabolic rates and cell size (a proxy for coccosphere size). I show that growth, photosynthesis and, to a lesser extent, calcification covary with cell size when pCO(2), irradiance, temperature, nitrate, phosphate and iron conditions change. With the exception of phosphate and temperature, a change from limiting to non-limiting conditions always results in an increase in cell size. An increase in phosphate or temperature (below the optimum temperature for growth) produces the opposite effect. The magnitude of the coccosphere-size changes observed in the laboratory is comparable to that observed in the ocean. If the biological reasons behind the environment-metabolism-size link are understood, it will be possible to use coccosphere-size changes in the modern ocean and in marine sediments to investigate the fate of coccolithophores in the future ocean. This reasoning can be extended to the size of coccoliths if, as recent experiments are starting to show, coccolith size reacts to environmental change proportionally to coccosphere size. The coccolithophore database is strongly biased in favour of experiments with the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (E. huxleyi; 82% of database entries), and more experiments with other species are needed to understand whether these observations can be extended to coccolithophores in general. I introduce a simple model that simulates the growth rate and the size of cells forced by nitrate and phosphate concentrations. By considering a simple rule that allocates the energy flow from nutrient acquisition to cell structure (biomass) and cell maturity (biological complexity, eventually leading to cell division), the model is able to reproduce the covariation of growth rate and cell size observed in laboratory experiments with E. huxleyi when these nutrients become limiting. These results support ongoing efforts to interpret coccosphere and coccolith size measurements in the context of climate change.","2015","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"4665-4692",NA,"15",12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000360003700008",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Long-term adaptation to novel environments is a dynamic process, and phenotypic change can take place thousands of generations after exposure to novel conditions. We conducted a long-term evolution experiment (4 years = 2100 generations), starting with a single clone of the abundant and widespread coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi exposed to three different CO2 levels simulating ocean acidification (OA). Growth rates as a proxy for Darwinian fitness increased only moderately under both levels of OA [+3.4% and +4.8%, respectively, at 1100 and 2200 matm partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2)] relative to control treatments (ambient CO2, 400 matm). Long-term adaptation to OA was complex, and initial phenotypic responses of ecologically important traits were later reverted. The biogeochemically important trait of calcification, in particular, that had initially been restored within the first year of evolution was later reduced to levels lower than the performance of nonadapted populations under OA. Calcification was not constitutively lost but returned to control treatment levels when high CO2-adapted isolates were transferred back to present-day control CO2 conditions. Selection under elevated CO2 exacerbated a general decrease of cell sizes under long-term laboratory evolution. Our results show that phytoplankton may evolve complex phenotypic plasticity that can affect biogeochemically important traits, such as calcification.

However, phytoplankton species with short generation times, in particular, may be able to respond to environmental alterations through adaptive evolution. Here, we examine the ability of the world's single most important calcifying organism, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, to evolve in response to ocean acidification in two 500-generation selection experiments. Specifically, we exposed E. huxleyi populations founded by single or multiple clones to increased concentrations of CO2. Around 500 asexual generations later we assessed their fitness. Compared with populations kept at ambient CO2 partial pressure, those selected at increased partial pressure exhibited higher growth rates, in both the single-and multiclone experiment, when tested under ocean acidification conditions. Calcification was partly restored: rates were lower under increased CO2 conditions in all cultures, but were up to 50% higher in adapted compared with non-adapted cultures.

These tiny primary producers have an important role in the global carbon cycle, substantially contributing to global ocean calcification, ballasting organic matter to the deep sea, forming part of the marine food web base, and influencing ocean atmosphere CO2 exchange. Despite these important impacts, coccolithophores are not explicitly simulated in most marine ecosystem models and, therefore, their impacts on carbon cycling are not represented in most Earth system models. Here, we compile field and laboratory data to synthesize overarching, across-species relationships between environmental conditions and coccolithophore growth rates and relative calcification (reported as a ratio of particulate inorganic carbon to particulate organic carbon in coccolithophore biomass, PIC/POC). We apply our relationships in a generalized coccolithophore model, estimating current surface ocean coccolithophore growth rates and relative calcification, and projecting how these may change over the 21st century using output from the Community Earth System Model large ensemble. We find that average increases in sea surface temperature of similar to 2-3 degrees C lead to faster coccolithophore growth rates globally (>10% increase) and increased calcification at high latitudes. Roughly an ubiquitous doubling of surface ocean pCO(2) by the end of the century has the potential to moderately stimulate coccolithophore growth rates, but leads to reduced calcification (similar to 25% decrease). Decreasing nutrient availability (from warming-induced increases in stratification) produces increases in relative calcification, but leads to similar to 25% slower growth rates. With all drivers combined, we observe decreases in calcification and growth in most low and mid latitude regions, with possible increases in both of these responses in most high latitude regions. Major limitations of our coccolithophore model stem from a lack of conclusive physiological responses to changes in irradiance (we do not include light limitation in our model), and a lack of physiological data for major coccolithophore species. Species within the Umbellosphaera genus, for example, are dominant in mid to low latitude regions where we predict some of the largest decreases in coccolithophore growth rate and calcification.","2017-12","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"276-295",NA,"",159,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000418980600018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Here, we report bio-optical and coccolithophore observations from the massive under-ice algal bloom originally described in Arrigo et al. (2012). The most intense portions of the bloom were centered in cold Winter Water and there was evidence for nitrate drawdown in the top 10-20 m with strong penetration of silicate rich water into the surface waters. Surface chlorophyll alpha and particulate absorption at 440 nm approached 30 mu g L-1 and 1.0 m(-1), respectively. Particulate absorption of detritus (alpha(p) at 412 nm) was highly correlated to alpha(p) at 440 nm associated with chlorophyll a and slopes of the absorption spectrum showed that both dissolved and particulate absorption at 412 nm exceeded that at 440 nm, with slopes, S-g, of 0.01 nm(-1). Colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence (FDOM) was high in the bloom but the relative fluorescence yields were low, characteristic of phytoplankton-produced FDOM (as opposed to terrestrially-produced FDOM). Coccolithophore backscattering was elevated in the under-ice bloom, but it only accounted for 10% of the total particle backscattering, relatively low compared to typical subpolar waters further to the south. Total particle scattering was significantly elevated in the under-ice bloom (values of almost 2 m(-1)), likely due to the high abundance of large diatoms. Backscattering probabilities in the bloom were similar to 1%, again characteristic of diatom-dominated populations with few calcifiers. PIC standing stock in the under-ice bloom was low but measurable while biogenic silica molar concentrations were 150 times greater. POC: PON molar ratios were 6-10, characteristic of healthy, rapidly growing phytoplankton, observations further buttressed by carbon:chlorophyll mass ratios of 50-100. Coccolithophore calcification was low but measurable, reaching 1.75 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in the under-ice bloom, only 0.4% of the photosynthesis. However, the intrinsic carbon-specific growth rate was 0.4 per day for bulk POC and similar to 1 per day for bulk PIC, close to maximal growth rates expected at these temperatures. SEM and light microscopy results showed mostly diatoms in the bloom. The coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi, was observed, providing unequivocal evidence of the presence of coccolithophores in the under-ice algal bloom. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Coccoliths are produced intracellularly, and cells produce coccoliths with stable isotopes distinct from theoretically precipitated inorganic calcite due to the influences of coccolithophore physiology, which are the so-called vital effects. The coccolith isotopic vital effects show large variations between species and hamper the use of coccolith isotopes in paleoceanography. In addition, learning the coccolith isotopic vital effects can help to better understand the carbon fractionation in coccolithophore cell, so as to provide a new insight in reconstructing sea water carbonate system (e.g., from alkenone delta C-13 or directly from coccolith delta C-13) in geological past. In the present study, we investigated the morphological parameters, growth rate, and coccolith stable isotope compositions of Gephyrocapsa, the most universal alkenone-producing coccolithophore across the Pleistocene. These data allow us to estimate the influences of Gephyrocapsa morphology as well as the growth rate on coccolith vital effects. The results showed that Gephyrocapsa morphology, as well as coccolith isotopes, varied with species and morphotype changes, which were evolutionarily forced over the past 400 ka. The small Gephyrocapsa morphotypes (G. caribbeanica and Gephyrocapsa <3 mu m) produced more robust coccoliths with relatively heavier isotopes for both carbon and oxygen than that of the larger-sized G. oceanica. The carbon and oxygen vital effects were significantly correlated and showed negative values, suggesting a kinetic effect on bicarbonate formation during calcification. The Gephyrocapsa growth rate showed a glacial-interglacial cyclicality, and had close relations with coccolith isotopic vital effects before MIS 8 when G. oceanica dominated. It is suggested that coccolith isotopic fractionation were influenced by coccolithophore growth rate, however these effects were superimposed on an evolutionary forced coccolithophore (coccolith) size changes.

To make robust projections of future global marine primary production, it is crucial to understand multiple driver effects on phytoplankton. This meta-analysis quantifies individual and interactive effects of dual driver combinations on marine phytoplankton growth rates. Almost 50% of the single-species laboratory studies were excluded because central data and metadata (growth rates, carbonate system, experimental treatments) were insufficiently reported. The remaining data (42 studies) allowed for the analysis of interactions ofpCO(2)with temperature, light, and nutrients, respectively. Growth rates mostly respond non-additively, whereby the interaction with increasedpCO(2)profusely dampens growth-enhancing effects of high temperature and high light. Multiple and single driver effects on coccolithophores differ from other phytoplankton groups, especially in their high sensitivity to increasingpCO(2). Polar species decrease their growth rate in response to highpCO(2), while temperate and tropical species benefit under these conditions. Based on the observed interactions and projected changes, we anticipate primary productivity to: (a) first increase but eventually decrease in the Arctic Ocean once nutrient limitation outweighs the benefits of higher light availability; (b) decrease in the tropics and mid-latitudes due to intensifying nutrient limitation, possibly amplified by elevatedpCO(2); and (c) increase in the Southern Ocean in view of higher nutrient availability and synergistic interaction with increasingpCO(2). Growth-enhancing effect of high light and warming to coccolithophores, mainlyEmiliania huxleyi, might increase their relative abundance as long as not offset by acidification. Dinoflagellates are expected to increase their relative abundance due to their positive growth response to increasingpCO(2)and light levels.

Low stable irradiance resulted in higher light harvesting pigment concentrations, lower RuBisCO activity and a lower light saturation point (E-k) compared to the other irradiance regimes. Highest RuBisCO activity as well as P-max levels was measured in the shallow mixing regime, which received the highest total daily light dose.

Here, we measure the capacity of the ecologically important purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to adapt to OA, using a breeding experiment to estimate additive genetic variance for larval size (an important component of fitness) under future high-pCO(2)/low-pH conditions. Although larvae reared under future conditions were smaller than those reared under present-day conditions, we show that there is also abundant genetic variation for body size under elevated pCO(2), indicating that this trait can evolve. The observed heritability of size was 0.40 +/- 0.32 (95% CI) under low pCO(2), and 0.50 +/- 0.30 under high-pCO(2) conditions. Accounting for the observed genetic variation in models of future larval size and demographic rates substantially alters projections of performance for this species in the future ocean. Importantly, our model shows that after incorporating the effects of adaptation, the OA-driven decrease in population growth rate is up to 50% smaller, than that predicted by the no-adaptation' scenario. Adults used in the experiment were collected from two sites on the coast of the Northeast Pacific that are characterized by different pH regimes, as measured by autonomous sensors. Comparing results between sites, we also found subtle differences in larval size under high-pCO(2) rearing conditions, consistent with local adaptation to carbonate chemistry in the field. These results suggest that spatially varying selection may help to maintain genetic variation necessary for adaptation to future OA.","2013-08","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"2536-2546",NA,"8",19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000328744900020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Model projections predict rapid environmental change in the coming decades, including ocean acidification, warming, and changes in nutrient supply which pose a serious risk for marine ecosystems. Yet despite the importance of the Subantarctic Zone, annual and inter-annual time series are extremely rare, leading to important uncertainties about the current state of its ecosystems and hindering predictions of future response to climate change. Moreover, as the longest observational time series available are only a few decades long, it remains unknown whether marine pelagic ecosystems have already responded to ongoing environmental change during the industrial era. Here, we take advantage of multiple sampling efforts - monitoring of surface layer water properties together with sediment trap, seafloor sediment and sediment core sampling - to reconstruct the modern and pre-industrial state of the keystone calcifying phytoplankton Calcidiscus leptoporus, central to the global marine carbonate cycle. Morphometric measurements reveal that modern C. leptoporus coccoliths are 15% lighter and 25% smaller than those preserved in the underlying Holocene-aged sediments. The cumulative effect of multiple environmental factors appears responsible for the coccolith size variations since the Last Deglaciation, with warming and ocean acidification most likely playing a predominant role during the industrial era. Notably, extrapolation of our results suggests a future reduction in cell and coccolith size which will have a negative impact on the efficiency of the biological pump in the Southern Ocean through a reduction of carbonate ballasting. Lastly, our results tentatively suggest that C. leptoporus coccolith size could be used as a palaeo-proxy for growth rate. Future culture experiments will be needed to test this hypothesis.","2023-06-22","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001020005700001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

While understanding of their physiological and molecular responses to individual stressors anticipated in the future ocean has improved, their responses to multiple concurrent stressors remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the individual and combined effects of elevated temperature (26 degrees C relative to 22 degrees C), increased p CO 2 (1000 mu atm relative to 400 mu atm), and high nitrogen: phosphorus ratio (180:1 relative to 40:1) on a harmful algal bloom-causing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum obtusidens under short-term (28 days) exposure. Elevated temperature was the most dominant stressor affecting P. obtusidens at physiological and transcriptomic levels. It significantly increased cell growth rate and maximum photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), but reduced chlorophyll a , particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, and particulate organic phosphorus. Elevated temperature also interacted with other stressors to produce synergistic positive effects on cell growth and Fv/Fm. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that elevated temperature promoted energy production by enhancing glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and nitrogen and carbon assimilation, which supported rapid cell growth but reduced material storage. Increased p CO 2 enhanced the expression of genes involved in ionic acid-base regulation and oxidative stress resistance, whereas a high N:P ratio inhibited photosynthesis, compromising cell viability, although the effect was alleviated by elevated temperature. The combined effect of these multiple stressors resulted in increased energy metabolism and up-regulation of material-synthesis pathways compared to the effect caused by elevated temperature alone. Our results underscore ocean warming as the predominant stressor for dinoflagellates and highlight the complex, synergistic effects of multi-stressors on dinoflagellates.","2024-11-20","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"",952,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001308620600001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Both the diploid and the haploid life stages were studied. Batch cultures were grown under 4 conditions: 400 mu atm and 19 degrees C; 400 mu atm and 22 degrees C; 740 mu atm and 19 degrees C; and 740 mu atm and 22 degrees C. The growth rate (mu) significantly increased under elevated pCO(2) only in the haploid stage and showed a different pattern with respect to temperature: it was higher at an elevated temperature in the haploid stage at 400 mu atm whereas it decreased in the diploid stage at 740 mu atm. Increasing both parameters together increased the growth rate by 11 % in the haploid stage only. Elevated pCO(2) had a negative impact on the content of particulate organic carbon (POC), production and cell size in both life stages at 19 degrees C, while no significant effect was observed at 22 degrees C. Increasing temperature significantly increased the content of POC and production in the diploid stage at 740 mu atm, while at 400 mu atm it significantly decreased both the content of POC and production in the haploid stage. A simultaneous increase in pCO(2) and temperature had a negative effect on the content of POC and production in the haploid stage only. Neither the rate of calcification (production of particulate inorganic carbon, PIC) nor the PIC:POC ratio were significantly affected by elevated pCO(2), temperature or their interaction. These results showed a strong interactive effect between pCO(2) and temperature in affecting the physiology of S. pulchra, an effect that was often more pronounced in the haploid life stage. Elevated pCO(2) had a stronger effect than temperature.","2011","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"221-232",NA,"3",64,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000296265000002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

These life cycle phases vary significantly in inorganic carbon content and morphology and inhabit distinct niches, with haploids generally preferring low-nitrogen and high-temperature and high-light environments in situ. This niche contrast indicates different physiology of the life cycle phases, which is considered here in the context of a trait trade-off framework, in which a particular set of traits comes with both costs and benefits. However, coccolithophore's phase trade-offs are not fully identified, limiting our understanding of the functionality of the coccolithophore life cycle. Here, we investigate the response of the two life cycle phases of the coccolithophore Coccolithus braarudii to key environmental drivers: light, temperature, and nitrogen, using laboratory experiments. With these data, we identify the main trade-offs of each life cycle phase and use models to test the role of such trade-offs under different environmental conditions. The lab experiments show the life cycle phases have similar cell size, minimum nitrogen quotas, uptake rates, and temperature and light optima. However, we find that they have different coccosphere sizes, maximum growth rates, and maximum nitrogen quotas. We also observe a trade-off between maximum growth rate and maximum nitrogen quota, with higher growth rates and low maximum nitrogen quotas in the haploid phase and vice versa in the diploid phase. Testing these phase characteristics in a numerical chemostat model, we find that the growth-quota trade-off allows C. braarudii to exploit variable nitrogen conditions more efficiently. Because the diploid ability to store more nitrogen is advantageous when the nitrogen supply is intermittent, the higher haploid growth rate is advantageous when the nitrogen supply is constant. Although the ecological drivers of C. braarudii life cycle fitness are likely multi-faceted, spanning both top-down and bottom-up trait trade-offs, our results suggest that a trade-off between nitrogen storage and maximum growth rate is an essential bottom-up control on the distribution of C. braarudii life cycle phases.","2024-04-08","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"1707-1727",NA,"7",21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001198246300001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"

Here, we measure changes in cellular function and growth rate at atmospheric CO2 concentrations predicted for the year 2100 in 16 ecotypes of the marine picoplankton Ostreococcus. We find that variation in plastic responses among ecotypes is on par with published between-genera variation, so the responses of one or a few ecotypes cannot estimate changes to the physiology or composition of a species under CO2 enrichment. We show that ecotypes best at taking advantage of CO2 enrichment by changing their photosynthesis rates most should increase in relative fitness, and so in frequency in a high-CO2 environment. Finally, information on sampling location, and not phylogenetic relatedness, is a good predictor of ecotypes likely to increase in frequency in this system.","2013-03","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"298-302",NA,"3",3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000319399000029",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reject","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah"
