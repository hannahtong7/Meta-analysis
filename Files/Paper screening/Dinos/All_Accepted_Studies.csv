Here, we investigated how the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (BOF 92, a non-calcifying strain) responded to changes in temperature in short- and long-term thermal treatments. The specific growth rate after 10 days of acclimation increased gradually with increasing temperatures (14, 17, 21, 24, 28 degrees C) and peaked at similar to 23 degrees C, followed by a significant decrease to 28 degrees C. Chlorophyll a content, cell size, photosynthetic rate, and respiratory rate increased significantly from 14 degrees C to 24 degrees C, but the cellular particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) showed the lowest values at the optimal temperature. In contrast, during long-term thermal treatments at 17 degrees C and 21 degrees C for 656 days (similar to 790 generations for 17 degrees C treatment; similar to 830 generations for 21 degrees C treatment), the warming significantly stimulated the growth in the first 34 days and the last 162 days, but there was no significant difference in specific growth rate from Day 35 to Day 493. Chlorophyll a content, cell size, cellular POC/PON, and the ratio of POC to PON, showed no significant difference between the warming and control for most of the duration of the long-term exposure. The warming-selected population did not acquire persistent traits in terms of growth and cell quotas of POC and PON, which resumed to the levels in the control temperature treatment after about 9 generations in the shift test. In summary, our results indicate that warming by 4 degrees C (17 degrees C and 21 degrees C) enhanced the growth, but did not result in adaptative changes in E. huxleyi (BOF 92) over a growth period of about 800 generations, reflecting that mild or non-stressful warming treatment to E. huxleyi isolated from cold seas does not alter its phenotypic plasticity.","2023-06-26","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"",NA,"",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001022463300001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","WWQT2HGI","Coccolithophores"

Cellular DMSP increased with increasing salinity, compatible with the hypothesis that DMSP is a compatible osmolyte. Cellular DMSP content was highest at colder temperatures and decreased as temperature increased. Net DMSP production rate also depended on cell size and growth rate was greatest about 2 degrees C below the optimum growth temperature of 20 degrees C for this clone. This resulted in a unimodal response of net DMSP production to increasing temperature: net DMSP production increased with increasing temperature when the cells were growing at temperatures below optimum for growth. At and above optimum growth temperature, further warming decreased net DMSP production. For the effect of temperature alone, in the subtropical oceans, where G. oceanica is growing at or above its optimum, further warming due to climate change will result in decreased net DMSP production and so a probable decrease in the flux of DMS to the atmosphere and sulphate aerosol production. Inasmuch as these aerosols modulate cloud albedo and longevity then these too will both decrease, resulting in a positive feedback response for temperature. The reverse effect may occur in higher latitude oceans where growth temperature is below optimum. The exact response in both regions is complicated because warming will also enhance water column stratification and may reduce mixed layer depths, affecting both nutrient and light regimes, as well as possible species succession effects. Further work is required to investigate these other indirect temperature effects.","2023-03-04","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"152-163",NA,"2",62,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000941199400001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","K27QKAMY","Coccolithophores"

The calcification response to temperature changes reported in the literature, however, is ambiguous. The two main sources of this ambiguity are putatively differences in experimental setup and strain specificity. In this study we therefore compare three strains isolated in the North Pacific under identical experimental conditions. Three strains of Emiliania huxleyi type A were grown under non-limiting nutrient and light conditions, at 10, 15, 20 and 25aEuro-A degrees C. All three strains displayed similar growth rate versus temperature relationships, with an optimum at 20-25aEuro-A degrees C. Elemental production (particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), particulate organic carbon (POC), total particulate nitrogen (TPN)), coccolith mass, coccolith size, and width of the tube element cycle were positively correlated with temperature over the sub-optimum to optimum temperature range. The correlation between PIC production and coccolith mass/size supports the notion that coccolith mass can be used as a proxy for PIC production in sediment samples. Increasing PIC production was significantly positively correlated with the percentage of incomplete coccoliths in one strain only. Generally, coccoliths were heavier when PIC production was higher. This shows that incompleteness of coccoliths is not due to time shortage at high PIC production. Sub-optimal growth temperatures lead to an increase in the percentage of malformed coccoliths in a strain-specific fashion. Since in total only six strains have been tested thus far, it is presently difficult to say whether sub-optimal temperature is an important factor causing malformations in the field. The most important parameter in biogeochemical terms, the PICaEuro-:aEuro-POC ratio, shows a minimum at optimum growth temperature in all investigated strains. This clarifies the ambiguous picture featuring in the literature, i.e. discrepancies between PICaEuro-:aEuro-POC-temperature relationships reported in different studies using different strains and different experimental setups. In summary, global warming might cause a decline in coccolithophore's PIC contribution to the rain ratio, as well as improved fitness in some genotypes due to fewer coccolith malformations.","2016","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"2913-2926",NA,"10",13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000378354900004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah","Coccolithophores"

Here, we examine the responses of the globally important marine coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi to thermal variations at two frequencies (1 d and 2 d) at low (18.5 degrees C) and high (25.5 degrees C) mean temperatures. Elevated temperature and thermal variation decreased growth, calcification and physiological rates, both individually and interactively. The 1 d thermal variation frequencies were less inhibitory than 2 d variations under high temperatures, indicating that high-frequency thermal fluctuations may reduce heat-induced mortality and mitigate some impacts of extreme high-temperature events. Cellular elemental composition and calcification was significantly affected by both thermal variation treatments relative to each other and to the constant temperature controls. The negative effects of thermal variation on E. huxleyi growth rate and physiology are especially pronounced at high temperatures. These responses of the key marine calcifier E. huxleyi to warmer, more variable temperature regimes have potentially large implications for ocean productivity and marine biogeochemical cycles under a future changing climate.","2019-11-20","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"4393-4409",NA,"22",16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000498701300001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah","Coccolithophores"

Replicate experimental populations derived from a single genotype isolated from Norwegian coastal waters were grown at two temperatures for 2.5 years before assessing thermal responses at 6 temperatures ranging from 15 to 26 degrees C, with pCO(2) (400/1100/2200 mu atm) as a fully factorial additional factor. The two selection temperatures (15 degrees/26.3 degrees C) led to a marked divergence of thermal reaction norms. Optimal growth temperatures were 0.7 degrees C higher in experimental populations selected at 26.3 degrees C than those selected at 15.0 degrees C. An additional negative effect of high pCO(2) on maximal growth rate (8% decrease relative to lowest level) was observed. Finally, the maximum persistence temperature (T-max) differed by 1-3 degrees C between experimental treatments, as a result of an interaction between pCO(2) and the temperature selection. Taken together, we demonstrate that several attributes of thermal reaction norms in phytoplankton may change faster than the predicted progression of ocean warming.","2016-10","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"1156-1164",NA,"9",9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000387763200011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah","Coccolithophores"

Coccolithophores are vulnerable to ocean acidification and warming, therefore it is critical to establish the effects of climate change on these significant marine primary producers, and determine potential consequences that these changes can have on their consumers. Here, we quantified the impact of changes in pH and temperature on the nutritional condition (lipid content, particulate organic carbon/nitrogen), growth rate, and morphology of the most abundant living coccolithophore species, Emiliania huxleyi. We used a regression type approach with nine pH levels (ranging from 7.66 to 8.44) and two temperatures (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C). Lipid production was greater under reduced pH, and growth rates were distinctly lower at 15 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. The production potential of lipids, which estimates the availability of lipids to consumers, increased under 20 degrees C, but decreased under low pH. The results indicate that, while consumers will benefit energetically under ocean warming, this benefit will be mitigated by ocean acidification. The carbon to nitrogen ratio was higher at 20 degrees C and low pH, indicating that the nutritional quality of coccolithophores for consumers will decline under climate change. The impact of low pH on the structural integrity of the coccosphere may also mean that coccolithophores are easier to digest for consumers. Many responses suggest cellular stress, indicating that increases in temperature and reductions in pH may have a negative impact on the ecophysiology of coccolithophores.","2022-10","2025-03-12 16:36:15","2025-03-12 16:36:15",NA,"2309-2324",NA,"10",67,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000846459400001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Hannah","Coccolithophores"

This study revealed the transcriptomic and physiological responses of a model diatom species P. tricornutum to ocean warming at an elevated temperature (25 degrees C in comparison with 20 degrees C) under scenarios of heat shock (-7 days; -7 generations) and heat selection (-175 days; -165 generations).

Transcriptomics analysis showed that elevated temperature suppressed signaling pathways related to photosynthesis but activated signaling pathways involving in fatty acid metabolism and nitrogen metabolism following the heat selection, associated with elevated substance storage and enlarged cell size. As a result, the increase of both C and N suggest that more energy was likely allocated to growth than division under ocean warming.

CO2 had significant effects on the POC production rate, cellular BSi, POC, and PON contents, the C:P, Si:C, N:P, and Si:P ratios, and sinking rate.

Both warming levels significantly increased the cell growth rate but decreased the chlorophyll a content. The contents of particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) decreased significantly initially (i.e., until 300 generations) at two temperature treatments but completely recovered after 700 generations of selection, suggesting that S. dohrnii ultimately developed thermal adaptation. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that elevated temperatures upregulated energy metabolism via glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation as well as nitrogen acquisition and utilization, which in turn reduced substance storage because of trade-off in the 300th generation, thus decreasing POC and PON. Interestingly, populations at both elevated temperatures exhibited significant proteome plasticity in the 700th generation, as primarily demonstrated by the increased lipid catabolism and glucose accumulation, accounting for the recovery of POC and PON. Changes occurring in cells at the 300th and 700th generations demonstrate that S. dohrnii can adapt to the projected OW, and readjusting the energy metabolism is an important adaptive strategy.","2022-04-19","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31",NA,"5247-5255",NA,"8",56,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000793137500055",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","RQEJ2PGF","Diatoms"

However, little is known about the adaptation of phytoplankton in warm seas. Across the ocean, diatomic microalgae are the main primary producers in cold waters; they also contribute to tropical communities where they play a necessary role in the biological pump. Here we show that four species of diatoms isolated from the tropical Red Sea adapted to warming conditions (30 degrees C) after 200-600 generations by using various thermal strategies. Two of the warming adapted species increased their optimal growth temperature (T-opt) and maximum growth rate. The other two diatoms did not increase T-opt and growth, but shifted from specialist to generalist increasing their maximum critical thermal limit. Our data show that tropical diatoms can adapt to warming, although trade offs on photosynthetic efficiency, high irradiance stress, and lower growth rate could alter their competitive fitness.

When exposed to a change in environmental milieu two main responses can be attained by cells: acclimation or homoeostasis. Recent studies testing the impact of other environmental factors indicated that the choice between these strategies is related to growth rates, i.e. cells dividing at a faster rate showed inclination to acclimation while cells dividing at a slower rate were more prone to homoeostasis. These findings motivated us to further explore the extent to which these compositional response modes are applied under varying temperature. Two representative marine diatoms, one centric, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and one pennate, Cylindrotheca fusiformis were investigated. Species were cultured at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C and at two growth rates. Compositional response was analysed with respect to elemental stoichiometry (carbon, nitrogen, silica, phosphorus, sulphur, manganese, iron, zinc and copper) and the major organic pool ratios (carbohydrate:lipid, carbohydrate:protein and protein:lipid). While T. pseudonana exhibited an acclimation response to temperature, C. fusiformis proved to be strongly homoeostatic. In the case of T. pseudonana, our data showed that the variations in composition were consistent with the growth rate dependence hypothesis for many micronutrients, but not for carbon and nitrogen contents, and C:N ratio. These species-specific differences in response mode highlight the diversity in ecophysiological strategies of diatoms, which needs to be considered when predicting climate change responses.","2021-09-03","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31",NA,"462-472",NA,"5",60,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000685998900001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","JETXBGZL","Diatoms"

The biovolume-based pigments content of T. pseudonana responded largely to temperature, while that of T. punctigera responded more to photoperiod duration than to temperature. In T. pseudonana, shortest photoperiod enhanced cellular protein content and alleviated their temperature dependency. Continuous growth light reduced the photosynthetic capacity of T. pseudonana at the lowest temperature and reduced that of T. punctigera across temperatures. Moreover, we found the increasing temperature linearly increased the dark respiration rate (Rd) and molar ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) of T. pseudonana but decreased that of T. punctigera, with the scattered effects of photoperiod.

This study quantifies the thermal performance curves (TPCs) of FTs in the cosmopolitan model diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana, to advance understanding of trade-offs between physiological (photoacclimation, carbon fixation, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate uptake) and morphological traits (cell volume and frustule silicification). We show that each FT has substantial phenotypic plasticity and exhibits a unique TPC, varying in both shape and thermal optimum, and diverging from the growth response. The TPC for growth was symmetric with a thermal optimum (T-opt) of 18 degrees C. In comparison, the TPC for primary productivity was warm-skewed with a T-opt around 21 degrees C, whereas frustule silicification decreased linearly with increasing temperature. Together, this suggests that the optimal temperature for overall fitness is a balance of trade-offs in the underlying functional traits. Moreover, these results demonstrate that growth is not necessarily an accurate estimate of overall biogeochemical performance and that temperature change will likely influence elemental fluxes such as carbon and silicon. Finally, we show that temperature-driven changes in individual traits e.g., photoacclimation, can mimic responses experienced under other environmental stressors (high light) and so a multi-trait assessment is essential for accurate interpretation of the cellular impact of warming. This study also reveals that multi-trait analysis, in the context of TPCs, provides insight into the cellular physiology regulating the whole cell response and has the potential to provide better estimates of how diatom-mediated biogeochemical fluxes are likely to be impacted in the context of ocean warming. Analyzing the response of multiple traits more comprehensively over other environmental gradients may therefore provide a useful framework to advance understanding of how taxon-specific functional traits will respond to multifaceted ocean change.","2016","2025-03-12 17:12:31","2025-03-12 17:12:31",NA,"",NA,"",3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000457358000043",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","UXLIFH8Q","Diatoms"

The growth rate in RS9907 increased linearly with temperature up to the warm threshold (33 degrees C), but genes related with the heat-shock response were upregulated within the range of 28 to 33 degrees C, indicating significant cellular stress under warm conditions. Carbon fixation and assimilation genes (rcbLS, cbbA, zwf, glgP) showed minimum expression values at 20 degrees C and 33 degrees C, but the diel expression patterns of these genes remained unaffected by temperature conditions, being consistently upregulated during day-time. By contrast, some genes involved in photosynthesis (acpA, psbABO, psaABD) were strongly upregulated during night-time under warm conditions, suggesting regulatory imbalances during the diel cycle. Notably, the expression of genes related to the synthesis of osmolytes against salt stress and fatty acid desaturases, which are typically upregulated under cold temperature in other cyanobacteria, was induced in warm acclimated RS9907 cells. These results highlight distinct transcriptional mechanisms of thermal acclimation in members of the Synechococcus clade II compared to other cyanobacterial lineages. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the diverse and intricate ways in which marine cyanobacteria adapt to temperature fluctuations.","2025-01","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39",NA,"",NA,"",85,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001434167500001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","5A9KVBLN","Cyanobacteria"

Rising temperature decreased growth rate, contents of chlorophyll a, protein and sugar in the nitrate-grown cells, but only decreased protein content and significantly increased zeaxanthin content of the urea-grown cells. Expressions of CsoS2 protein involved in carboxysome formation and ribosomal subunits in both nitrate- and urea-grown cells were significantly decreased in rising temperature, whereas carbohydrate selective porin and sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) were remarkably up-regulated, and carbohydrate degradation associated proteins, i.e., glycogen phosphorylase kinase, fructokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, were down-regulated in the urea-grown cells. Rising temperature also increased expressions of three redox-sensitive enzymes (peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin, and CP12) in both nitrate-and urea-grown cells.

Yet, the molecular basis of thermal acclimation in this cyanobacterium remains unexplored. We analyzed the transcriptional response of the Prochlorococcus marinus strain MIT9301 in long-term acclimations and in natural Prochlorococcus populations along a temperature range enabling its growth (17 to 30 degrees C). MIT9301 upregulated mechanisms of the global stress response at the temperature minimum (17 degrees C) but maintained the expression levels of genes involved in essential metabolic pathways (e.g., ATP synthesis and carbon fixation) along the whole thermal niche. Notably, the declining growth of MIT9301 from the optimum to the minimum temperature was coincident with a transcriptional suppression of the photosynthetic apparatus and a dampening of its circadian expression patterns, indicating a loss in their regulatory capacity under cold conditions. Under warm conditions, the cellular transcript inventory of MIT9301 was strongly streamlined, which may also induce regulatory imbalances due to stochasticity in gene expression. The daytime transcriptional suppression of photosynthetic genes at low temperature was also observed in metatranscriptomic reads mapping to MIT9301 across the global ocean, implying that this molecular mechanism may be associated with the restricted distribution of Prochlorococcus to temperate zones. IMPORTANCE Prochlorococcus is a major marine primary producer with a global impact on atmospheric CO2 fixation. This cyanobacterium is widely distributed across the temperate ocean, but virtually absent at latitudes above 40 degrees for yet unknown reasons. Temperature has been suggested as a major limiting factor, but the exact mechanisms behind Prochlorococcus thermal growth restriction remain unexplored. This study brings us closer to understanding how Prochlorococcus functions under challenging temperature conditions, by focusing on its transcriptional response after long-term acclimation from its optimum to its thermal thresholds. Our results show that the drop in Prochlorococcus growth rate under cold conditions was paralleled by a transcriptional suppression of the photosynthetic machinery during daytime and a loss in the organism's regulatory capacity to maintain circadian expression patterns. Notably, warm temperature induced a marked shrinkage of the organism's cellular transcript inventory, which may also induce regulatory imbalances in the future functioning of this cyanobacterium.","2023-06-27","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39",NA,"",NA,"3",14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000970668200001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","N8CLZBSJ","Cyanobacteria"

While these studies provide insight into the evolutionary responses of single species, they tend to employ different experimental techniques. Consequently, our ability to compare the potential for thermal adaptation across different, ecologically relevant, species remains limited. Here, we address this limitation by conducting simultaneous long-term warming experiments with the same experimental design on clonal isolates of three phylogenetically diverse species of marine phytoplankton; the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp., the prasinophyte Ostreococcus tauri and the diatom Phaeodoactylum tricornutum. Over the same experimental time period, we observed differing levels of thermal adaptation in response to stressful supra-optimal temperatures. Synechococcus sp. displayed the greatest improvement in fitness (i.e., growth rate) and thermal tolerance (i.e., temperature limits of growth). Ostreococcus tauri was able to improve fitness and thermal tolerance, but to a lesser extent. Finally, Phaeodoactylum tricornutum showed no signs of adaptation. These findings could help us understand how the structure of phytoplankton communities may change in response to warming, and possible biogeochemical implications, as some species show relatively more rapid adaptive shifts in their thermal tolerance.","2023-07-03","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001019607900001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","KD6DEPQH","Cyanobacteria"

To decipher the effect of changing temperature and CO2 levels on Synechococcus, six Synechococcus strains previously isolated from various coastal and open ocean sites were exposed to a matrix of three different temperatures (22 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 26 degrees C) and CO2 levels (400 ppm, 600 ppm and 800 ppm). Thereafter, the specific growth rates, photophysiological parameters (sigma(PSII) and F-v/F-m), C/N (mol/mol) ratios and the nitrogen stable isotopic composition (delta N-15 (parts per thousand)) of the strains were measured. Temperature was found to be a stronger driver of the changes in specific growth rates and photophysiology in the Synechococcus strains.

Light availability significantly modulated the growth response of Trichodesmium to temperature, with the specific growth rate peaking at similar to 27 degrees C under the light-saturating conditions, while growth of light-limited cultures was non-responsive across the tested temperatures (23, 27, and 31 degrees C). Short-term thermal responses for N-2 fixation indicated that both high growth temperature and light intensity increased the optimum temperature (T-opt) for N-2 fixation and decreased its susceptibility to supra-optimal temperatures (deactivation energy - E-h). Simultaneously, all light-limited cultures with low T-opt and high E-h were unable to sustain N-2 fixation during short-term exposure to high temperatures (33-34 degrees C) that are not lethal for the cells grown under light-saturating conditions. Our results imply that Trichodesmium spp. growing under low light levels while distributed deep in the euphotic zone or under cloudy weather conditions might be less sensitive to long-term temperature changes that occur on the timescale of multiple generations but are more susceptible to abrupt (less than one generation time span) temperature changes, such as those induced by cyclones and heat waves.","2020-02-28","2025-03-12 19:31:39","2025-03-12 19:31:39",NA,"1169-1180",NA,"4",17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000518757100002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","PKCXXI9M","Cyanobacteria"

This study quantitatively determined the growth response of two Alexandrium isolates to a range of temperatures and salinities, factors that will strongly respond to future climate change scenarios. An empirical equation, derived from observed growth rates describing the temperature and salinity dependence of growth, was used to hindcast bloom risk. Hindcasting was achieved by comparing predicted growth rates, calculated from insitu temperature and salinity data from Quartermaster Harbor, with corresponding Alexandrium cell counts and shellfish toxin data. The greatest bloom risk, defined at >0.25d(-1), generally occurred from April through November annually; however, growth rates rarely fell below 0.10d(-1). Except for a few occasions, Alexandrium cells were only observed during the periods of highest bloom risk and paralytic shellfish toxins above the regulatory limit always fell within the periods of predicted bloom occurrence. While acknowledging that Alexandrium growth rates are affected by other abiotic and biotic factors, such as grazing pressure and nutrient availability, the use of this empirical growth function to predict higher risk time frames for blooms and toxic shellfish within the Salish Sea provides the groundwork for a more comprehensive biological model of Alexandrium bloom dynamics in the region and will enhance our ability to forecast blooms in the Salish Sea under future climate change scenarios.","2016-04","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27",NA,"230-238",NA,"2",52,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000373618400008",NA,NA,"","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;37<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;41<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;35</p>",NA,NA,"ACCUMULATION; Alexandrium; GONYAULAX-TAMARENSIS; growth rate; HAB; harmful algae; hindcast; IRRADIANCE; NARRAGANSETT BAY; PARALYTIC SHELLFISH; PATTERNS; Puget Sound; PUGET-SOUND; salinity; Salish Sea; temperature; TOXICITY; TOXINS; WASHINGTON",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Insert Screener Name","Dinoflagellates"

Also, the protein content of the dinoflagellate had been reduced by similar to 32% by the end of the warming period. The dry weight of T. weissflogii increased three-fold under +2 degrees C of warming. In contrast, the dry weight of Gymnodinium sp. decreased by similar to 78% and did not recover when warming was removed.

In particular, little is known about how future climate scenarios will affect the growth of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, which is responsible for the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) events that threaten the health and economy of coastal communities in the Gulf of Maine and elsewhere. The growth responses of A. catenella and two other naturally co-occurring dinoflagellates in the Gulf of Maine-Scrippsiella sp., and Amphidinium carterae-were studied in mono and mixed species cultures. Experimental treatments tested the effects of elevated temperature (20 degrees C), lower pH (7.8), and the combination of elevated temperature and lower pH on growth rates relative to those in near-current conditions (15 degrees C; pH 8.1). Growth rates of A. catenella decreased under elevated temperature and' lower pH conditions, a response that was largely attributable to the effect of temperature. In contrast, growth rates of Scrippsiella sp. and A. carterae increased under elevated temperature and lower pH conditions, with temperature, also .being the primary driver of the response. These trends did not change substantially when these species were grown in mixed cultures (A. catenella + Scrippsiella sp., and A. catenella + A. carterae), indicating that allelopathic or competitive interactions did not affect the experimental outcome under the conditions tested. These findings suggest that A. catenella blooms may become less prevalent in the southern regions of the Gulf of Maine, but potentially more prevalent in the northeastern regions of the Gulf of Maine with continued climate change.","2019-11","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27",NA,"",NA,"",89,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000496874100016",NA,NA,"","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;17<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>",NA,NA,"ADAPTATION; Alexandrium; Amphidinium; CARBON ACQUISITION; Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CO2; DIATOM; FUNDYENSE; Growth rate; Gulf of Maine; HAB; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; Multi-stressor; Ocean acidification; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; PCO(2); PH; Scrippsiella; Temperature; VARIABILITY",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Insert Screener Name","Dinoflagellates"

Understanding the production and transformation dynamics of these compounds under shifting environmental conditions is important for predicting their roles in a changing ocean. Here, we report the physiological and biochemical response of a robust strain of Alexandrium minutum, a dinoflagellate with the highest reported intracellular DMSP content, exposed to a 6 d increase in temperature mimicking mild and extreme coastal marine heatwave conditions (+4 and +12 degrees C). Under mild temperature increases (+4 degrees C), A. minutum growth was enhanced, with no measurable physiological stress response. However, under a very acute increase in temperature (+12 degrees C) triggering thermal stress, A. minutum growth declined, photosynthetic efficiency (F-V/F-M) was impaired, and enhanced oxidative stress was observed. These physiological responses indicative of thermal stress were accompanied by increased DMS and DMSO concentrations followed by decreased DMSP concentration. At this temperature extreme, we observed a cascading stress response in A. minutum, which was initiated 6 h after the start of the experiment by a spike in DMS and DMSO concentrations and a rapid decrease in F-V/F-M. This was followed by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an abrupt decline in DMS and DMSO on day 2 of the experiment. A subsequent decrease in DMSP coupled with a decline in the growth rate of both A. minutum and its associated total bacterial assemblage coincided with a shift in the composition of the A. minutum microbiome. Specifically, an increase in the relative abundance of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) matching Oceanicaulis (17.0 %), Phycisphaeraceae SM1A02 (8.8 %) and Balneola (4.9 %) as well as a decreased relative abundance of Maribacter (24.4 %), Marinoscillum (4.7 %) and Seohaeicola (2.7 %) were primarily responsible for differences in microbiome structure observed between temperature treatments. These shifts in microbiome structure are likely to have been driven by either the temperature itself, the changing physiological state of A. minutum cells, shifts in biogenic sulfur concentrations, the presence of other solutes, or a combination of all. Nevertheless, we suggest that these results point to the significant effect of extreme heatwaves on the physiology, growth and microbiome composition of the redtide causing dinoflagellate A. minutum, as well as potential implications for biogenic sulfur cycling processes and marine DMS emissions.","2019-11-19","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27",NA,"4377-4391",NA,"22",16,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000498640300001",NA,NA,"","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>",NA,NA,"ATMOSPHERIC SULFUR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIMETHYLSULFONIOPROPIONATE DMSP CONCENTRATION; DIMETHYLSULFOXIDE DMSO; FORAGING CUE; LYASE ACTIVITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; STRESS; SULFIDE; TEMPERATURE",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Insert Screener Name","Dinoflagellates"

Growth rates of S. gracilenta with and without Teleaulax amphioxeia prey as well as ingestion rates were significantly affected by water temperature. Growth rates of S. gracilenta with and without prey were positive or zero at 5-25 degrees C but were negative at >= 30 degrees C.

Habitat warming associated with anthropogenic climate change has detrimentally impacted marine primary production, with the effects observed on regional and global scales. In contrast to slower-growing higher plants, there is considerable potential for phytoplankton to evolve rapidly with changing environmental conditions. The energetic constraints associated with adaptation in phytoplankton are not yet understood, but are central to forecasting how global biogeochemical cycles respond to contemporary ocean change. Here, we demonstrate a number of potential trade-offs associated with high-temperature adaptation in a tropical microbial eukaryote, Amphidinium massartii (dinoflagellate). Most notably, the population became high-temperature specialized (higher fitness within a narrower thermal envelope and higher thermal optimum), and had a greater nutrient requirement for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Evidently, the energetic constraints associated with living at elevated temperature alter competiveness along other environmental gradients. While high-temperature adaptation led to an irreversible change in biochemical composition (i.e., an increase in fatty acid saturation), the mechanisms underpinning thermal evolution in phytoplankton remain unclear, and will be crucial to understanding whether the trade-offs observed here are species-specific or are representative of the evolutionary constraints in all phytoplankton.","2018-12","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27",NA,"799-810",NA,"6",54,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000454908500005",NA,NA,"","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>",NA,NA,"ACID; adaptation; ADAPTATION; ALGAE; CHLOROPHYLL-A; COCCOLITHOPHORE; global warming; LIGHT; MODEL; phytoplankton; PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH; SYMBIODINIUM; TEMPERATURE; thermal niche; thermal performance curves",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Insert Screener Name","Dinoflagellates"

The morphology of both cells and cysts from the field and cultures was examined with LM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Large subunit (LSU) and/or internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-5.8S rRNA gene sequences were obtained in 13 isolates from bloom samples and five strains from cysts. In addition, cells of strains TIO523 and GCLY02 (from the Taiwan Strait and Yellow Sea of China, respectively) were subjected to growth experiments, and cysts from the field were used for germination experiments under various temperatures. Our strains shared identical LSU and ITS-5.8S rRNA gene sequences with those from other parts of the world, and therefore belonged to a global population.

Our results also suggested that the persistence of cells in the water column may have initiated the bloom.","2020-07","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27",NA,"",NA,"",97,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000555112000010",NA,NA,"","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;33<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;35<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>",NA,NA,"BAHIA-CONCEPCION; Blooms; Ecotype; Growth; GULF-OF-CALIFORNIA; Hydroxybenzoate toxins; LIFE-CYCLE; MEXICAN PACIFIC; MICRORETICULATE CYST; PARALYTIC SHELLFISH; Paralytic shellfish toxins; RECENT MARINE-SEDIMENTS; RESTING CYSTS; SP-NOV DINOPHYCEAE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Insert Screener Name","Dinoflagellates"

These blooms have variable toxicity which may be related to bloom stage and in situ growth rates of the constituent K. veneficum cells. Measurement of in situ growth rates is challenging and methods such as the mitotic index technique require knowledge of the dynamics of cell division. In order to better understand these dynamics, we determined the duration of cell division (td) in four geographically distinct laboratory strains of K. veneficum at three different environmentally relevant temperatures. The results demonstrated that the td value for each strain, growing at strain-specific optimal temperatures, was 1.6 +/- 0.1 h. This value corresponded to a range of growth rates from 0.17 +/- 0.08 d-1 to 0.62 +/- 0.07 d-1. Equivalent values of td spread across four geographically distinct laboratory strains and a nearly fourfold range of growth rates implies that 1.6 h represents the td value of K. veneficum. Additionally, temperature conditions yielding this value for td and the highest growth rates varied among strains, indicating cold-adapted (Norway), warm-adapted (Florida, USA), and eurythermally-adapted (Maryland, USA) strains. These differences have been apparently retained in culture over many years, indicating a conserved genetic basis that suggests distinct thermal ecotypes of the morphospecies K. veneficum. This knowledge together with the first estimate of td for K. veneficum will be useful in future field studies aimed at correlating bloom toxicity with in situ growth rate using the mitotic index technique.","2024-01","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27",NA,"",NA,"",131,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001138177800001",NA,NA,"","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>",NA,NA,"Cell cycle; CELL-CYCLE; CHESAPEAKE-BAY; Cytokinesis; DIEL; Dinoflagellate; DINOFLAGELLATE; DINOPHYCEAE; Duration of mitosis; Ecotype; GYMNODINIUM-GALATHEANUM; Harmful algal bloom; In situ growth rate; Karlodinium veneficum; Mitotic index; PATTERNS; PHYTOPLANKTON; POPULATIONS; RATES",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Insert Screener Name","Dinoflagellates"

A sediment survey in Ria de Vigo in April 1986 indicated that the highest concentrations of cysts of this species were located in the middle sections of the ria, with maximum abundance of 310 cysts cm-3. The effects of temperature, growth medium composition and irradiance on the germination of laboratory-produced resting cysts were investigated. Newly formed cysts required very little time for maturation, as excystment was possible within 2 weeks of encystment. Growth media did not affect germination success. In contrast, the excystment rate was retarded significantly in darkness. Germination was also strongly affected by temperature, with approximately 75% excystment success at 22-28-degrees-C and little or no germination below 11-degrees-C after 1 month of incubation. In culture. the optimum growth rate of vegetative cells was between 22 and 28-degrees-C. the highest rate being 0.53 divisions day-1 at 24-degrees-C. Growth did not occur at temperatures < 11-degrees-C or >30-degrees-C. These results are important with respect to the different hypotheses proposed to explain the initiation of G.catenatum blooms in the Galician Rias Bajas and Northern Portugal. The pattern of G.catenatum bloom development along this coast has been related to seasonal upwelling in the area, with major blooms occurring during the autumn as warmer offshore surface water is transported towards the coast when upwelling relaxes. The landward transport of established offshore populations of G.catenatum with the warm surface layer remains a viable explanation for the observed blooms within the rias, but alternatively. our data suggest that cysts within the rias can provide the inoculum population at times conducive to growth and bloom formation. Even though newly formed G.catenatum cysts have a very short maturation time and can germinate in darkness across a wide temperature range, bloom development will be significant only during the late summer and early autumn, since in other months light levels at the sediment surface and temperatures throughout the water column are too low for significant germination or growth.","1994-05","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27",NA,"513-525",NA,"5",16,NA,NA,NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"English",NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1994NM09500006",NA,NA,"","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;82<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;87<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>",NA,NA,"BLOOMS; CERATIUM-HIRUNDINELLA; CYSTS; DINOPHYCEAE; GERMINATION; GONYAULAX-TAMARENSIS; GRAHAM; LIFE-CYCLE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; RED TIDE",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Accept","No reason given","No comments given","Insert Screener Name","Dinoflagellates"
