Yet, we lack understanding of how ecological interactions will be affected under ocean warming and acidification (OWA) conditions. We tested the antagonistic effects of three strains of the dinoflagellate HAB species Alexandrium catenella on three target species (the chlorophyte Tetraselmis sp., the cryptomonad Rhodomonas salina, and the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii) at various biomass ratios between species, at ambient (16 degrees C and 400 mu atm CO2) and OWA (20 degrees C and 2000 mu atm CO2) conditions. In these experiments the Alexandrium strains had been raised under OWA conditions for similar to 100 generations. All three non-HAB species increased their growth rate under OWA relative to ambient conditions. Growth rate inhibition was evident for R. salina and Tetraselmis sp. under OWA conditions, but not under ambient conditions. These negative effects were exacerbated at higher concentrations of Alexandrium relative to non-HAB species. By contrast, T. weissflogii showed positive growth in the presence of two strains of Alexandrium under ambient conditions, whereas growth was unaffected under OWA. Contrary to our expectations, A. catenella had a slight negative response in the presence of the diatom. These results demonstrate that Alexandrium exerts higher antagonistic effects under OWA compared to ambient conditions, and these effects are species-specific and density dependent. These negative effects may shift phytoplankton community composition under OWA conditions.","2024-04","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","134","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001287989000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;73</p>","","","Acclimation; Adaptation; Alexandrium; ALGAL BLOOMS; Allelopathy; ALLELOPATHY; CO2; GROWTH; HAB; Multi-stressor; Ocean acidification; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; SEA-WATER; Strain variability; TAMARENSE; TEMPERATURE; TOXIC DINOFLAGELLATE; Warming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Greater frequency of HABs has been reported in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, including blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia selliformis, causing massive mortality of marine fauna in the oceanic and coastal areas of Patagonia. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of temperature and pH interaction on the growth of K. selliformis (strain CREAN_KS02), since these factors have wide seasonal fluctuations in the Patagonian fjord ecosystem. The CREAN_KS02 strain isolated from the Ayse ' n Region (43 degrees S) was used in a factorial experiment with five pH levels (7.0, 7.4, 7.7, 8.1 and 9.0) and two temperatures (12 and 17 degrees C) during a period of 18-21 days. Results indicated a significant effect of temperature and pH interaction on growth rate (range 0.22 +/- 0.00 to 0.08 +/- 0.01 d-1) and maximum density (range 13,710 +/- 2,616 to 2,385 +/- 809 cells mL-1) of K. selliformis. The highest density and growth of K. selliformis was found at 12 degrees C with a reduced pH (7.0-7.7). The results suggest that the current environmental conditions of coastal Patagonia, waters of low temperature and relatively low pH, may be favorable for the development of blooms of this species during autumn. We suggest that there is natural plasticity of K. selliformis in a wide pH range (7.0-8.1) but in a narrow low temperature range (10.6-12.9 degrees C), values that are typically recorded in the oceanic region of northern Patagonia. In contrast, in an extreme climate change scenario (ocean warming and coastal acidification) in northern Patagonia, a negative effect on the growth of K. selliformis may be expected due to amplification of the acidification effects caused by the thermal stress of high temperature water.","2023-02","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","211","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000993448400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;113</p>","","","Carbonate system; Chilean fjords; CO2; Coastal acidification; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; GYMNODIMINE; Harmful algal blooms; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; HIGH PH; INORGANIC CARBON; MOLECULAR-DETECTION; NORTHERN PATAGONIA; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; Ocean warming; SOUTHERN CHILE; Toxic dinoflagellate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, Prorocentrum donghaiense, a typical red tide species in the East China Sea, was exposed to different MP concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 10 mg L-1) and temperatures (16, 22, and 28 C) for 7 days to investigate the combined effects of MPs and simulated ocean warming by measuring different physiological parameters, such as cell growth, pigment contents (chlorophyll a and carotenoid), relative electron transfer rate (rETR), reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The results demonstrated that MPs significantly decreased cell growth, pigment contents, and rETR(max), but increased the MDA, ROS, and SOD levels for all MP treatments at low temperature (16 C). However, high temperatures (22 and 28 C) increased the pigment contents and rETR(max), but decreased the SOD and MDA levels. Positive and negative effects of high temperatures (22 or 28C) were observed at low (1 and 5 mg L-1) and high MP (10 mg L-1) concentrations, respectively, indicating the antagonistic and synergistic effects of combined warming and MP pollution. These results imply that the effects of MPs on microalgae will likely not be substantial in future warming scenarios if MP concentrations are controlled at a certain level.

Under calculated conditions for pH((total scale)) and pCO(2) ranging from 7.73-8.66 to 69.7-721.3 mu atm, respectively, the Chilean strain Q09 presented an optimum growth rate and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) uptake at near-equilibrium pCO(2)/pH conditions (similar to 8.1). DistaLM analysis between physiological relevant carbonate system parameters (CO2, HCO3-, and H+) and cellular rates (growth rate and DIC uptake) identified HCO3- as the unique variable explaining a significant portion of the physiological response. Estimations of equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) and chain-formation index (CI) revealed reduced cell size and enhanced chain formation at high pH/low pCO(2) conditions. Light intensity as co-factor during experiments (50 vs. 100 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) produced no effect on ESD and CI. Cells exposed to low light; however, had reduced cell growth and DIC uptake especially at high pH/low pCO(2). We suggest that A. catenella Chilean strains are highly adapted to spatio-temporal pCO(2)/pH fluctuations in Chilean fjords, becoming a resilient winner from expected climate change effects.","2017-05","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","988-995","","4","74","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000404450100010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;50</p>","","","Alexandrium catenella; cell size; chain-formation; Chilean fjords; CO2; COMMUNITY; DIC uptake; ECOSYSTEMS; ENRICHMENT; harmful algal blooms; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; INORGANIC CARBON; MECHANISMS; OCEAN; PHYTOPLANKTON; RESPONSES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Karenia brevis is the major harmful algal species in the Gulf of Mexico producing potent neurotoxins known as brevetoxins. We examined how changes in ocean inorganic carbon chemistry associated with pre-industrial (250 ppm), recent (350 ppm), and predicted at 2100 (1000 ppm) pCO(2) levels and increased temperature affect growth rates and brevetoxin production in K. brevis. At the predicted pCO(2) levels for 2100, growth rate of K. brevis Wilson clone increased substantially by 46% at 25 degrees C (0.43 +/- 0.01 d(-1)) compared to recent and pre-industrial levels (0.29 +/- 0.01 d(-1)). Growth rates also increased for a low brevetoxin-producing clone, SP1, from 0.24 +/- 0.02 d(-1) at lower pCO(2) levels to 0.33 +/- 0.003 d(-1) at a pCO(2) of 1000 ppm. When grown at a higher temperature (30 C), growth rates for the Wilson clone significantly decreased at all three pCO2 by approximately 30%. However, even at the higher temperature, K. brevis growth rate significantly increased by 30% (0.30 +/- 0.01 d(-1)) at the 1000 ppm CO2 level when compared to recent and pre-industrial CO2 levels (0.21 +/- 0.01 d(-1)). Although K. brevis growth rate decreased at higher temperatures, the growth rate at pCO(2) level of 1000 and 30 degrees C was slightly higher than at current conditions (pCO(2) level of 350 and 25 C). Modification of pCO(2) levels and temperatures did not have an effect on total brevetoxin production or brevetoxin profiles in either clone examined. Due to the increased growth rate, total brevetoxin production was significantly higher at the pCO(2) level of 1000. Finally, from these results we conclude there is no connection between growth rate and brevetoxin per cell. Although neither pCO(2) nor temperature influenced brevetoxin production per cell, we suggest that under predicted future climate conditions K. brevis blooms have the potential to produce higher cell concentrations and increased brevetoxin concentrations, which will pose an increased risk for ecosystem and human health.

The growth rate and chain formation extent of A. affine increased with higher pCO(2), showing significant changes in cardinal temperatures and a substantial increase in middle chain-length (4.8 cells) fractionation under elevated pCO(2) condition. By contrast, there were no significant differences in specific growth rate and any chain-length fractionation of A. pacificum between ambient and elevated pCO(2) conditions. The observed interspecies variation in the functional traits may reflect differences in ability of species to respond to environmental change with plasticity. Moreover, it allows us to understand the shifting biogeography of marine phytoplankton and predict their phenology in the Korea Strait.","2021-12","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","285-298","","4","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000735205400004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","Alexandrium affine; Alexandrium pacificum; CARBON-CONCENTRATING MECHANISMS; cardinal temperature; chain formation; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CO2 CONCENTRATION; COASTAL WATERS; FUTURE; GROUP IV; growth rate; IMPACT; Korea Strait; ocean acidification; PHYTOPLANKTON; SENSITIVITY; TEMPERATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in the total proteome and physiological traits of the Mediterranean A. pacificum SG C10-3 strain were measured in response to increasing temperature (24 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 30 degrees C) and trace metal contamination (Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+). Warming reduced the cell densities and maximal growth rate (mu max), but the strain persisted at 30 degrees C with more large cells. The polymetallic stress increased cell sizes, reduced cell growth at 24 degrees C-27 degrees C and it increased this at 30 degrees C. Toxin profiles showed a predominance of GTX4 (32-38 %), then C2 (11-34 %) or GTX6 (18-24 %) among the total Paralytic Shellfish Toxins, however these were modified under warming, showing increased contents in GTX1 (among the most toxic), GTX5, C1 and NeoSTX, while dc-NeoSTX and STX (among the most toxic) only appeared at 30 degrees C. Under polymetallic contamination, warming also increased contents in GTX5 and NeoSTX. In contrast, polymetallic stress, or warming had harmful effects on C2 contents. Proteins were more quantitatively produced by A. pacificum SG C10-3 under warming in accordance with the high levels of up-regulated proteins found in the total proteome in this condition. Polymetallic stress, only or combined with warming, led to low proteomic modifications (1 % or 4 %), whereas warming induced strong 52 % modified proteomic response, mainly based on up-regulated proteins involved in photosynthesis (light harvesting complex protein), carbohydrate metabolism (arylsulfatase) and translation (ribosomal proteins), and with the lesser down-regulated proteins principally associated with the lipid metabolism (type I polyketide synthase). Our results show that warming triggers a strong up-regulated A. pacificum SG C10-3 proteomic response, which, coupled to modified cell sizes and toxin profiles, could help it to withstand stress conditions. This could presage the success of A. pacificum in anthropized ecosystems submitted to global warming in which this dinoflagellate also might be more toxic.","2024-12","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","209","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001355963500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;162</p>","","","Alexandrium pacificum; BIOCHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; CELL-SIZE; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; Global warming; GROUP IV; Harmful algal bloom; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; HEAT-STRESS; Paralytic shellfish toxin; PARALYTIC SHELLFISH TOXINS; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; Proteomics; TAMARENSIS LEBOUR; Trace metals; WATER TEMPERATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet the environmental conditions that promote accelerated growth of this organism, a producer of paralytic shellfish toxins, is lacking. This study quantitatively determined the growth response of two Alexandrium isolates to a range of temperatures and salinities, factors that will strongly respond to future climate change scenarios. An empirical equation, derived from observed growth rates describing the temperature and salinity dependence of growth, was used to hindcast bloom risk. Hindcasting was achieved by comparing predicted growth rates, calculated from insitu temperature and salinity data from Quartermaster Harbor, with corresponding Alexandrium cell counts and shellfish toxin data. The greatest bloom risk, defined at >0.25d(-1), generally occurred from April through November annually; however, growth rates rarely fell below 0.10d(-1). Except for a few occasions, Alexandrium cells were only observed during the periods of highest bloom risk and paralytic shellfish toxins above the regulatory limit always fell within the periods of predicted bloom occurrence. While acknowledging that Alexandrium growth rates are affected by other abiotic and biotic factors, such as grazing pressure and nutrient availability, the use of this empirical growth function to predict higher risk time frames for blooms and toxic shellfish within the Salish Sea provides the groundwork for a more comprehensive biological model of Alexandrium bloom dynamics in the region and will enhance our ability to forecast blooms in the Salish Sea under future climate change scenarios.","2016-04","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","230-238","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000373618400008","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;37<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;41<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;35</p>","","","ACCUMULATION; Alexandrium; GONYAULAX-TAMARENSIS; growth rate; HAB; harmful algae; hindcast; IRRADIANCE; NARRAGANSETT BAY; PARALYTIC SHELLFISH; PATTERNS; Puget Sound; PUGET-SOUND; salinity; Salish Sea; temperature; TOXICITY; TOXINS; WASHINGTON","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We clarified the effects of temperature and light intensity on the growth of a strain of P. cf. balticum isolated from the Oyashio-Kuroshio Mixed Water region and then estimated its potential habitat in the western North Pacific in the context of global warming. In batch cultures maintained at 5 degrees C30 degrees C, the highest growth was observed at 25 degrees C, while the viable temperature range was estimated to be 6.03 degrees C-29.4 degrees C.

While understanding of their physiological and molecular responses to individual stressors anticipated in the future ocean has improved, their responses to multiple concurrent stressors remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the individual and combined effects of elevated temperature (26 degrees C relative to 22 degrees C), increased p CO 2 (1000 mu atm relative to 400 mu atm), and high nitrogen: phosphorus ratio (180:1 relative to 40:1) on a harmful algal bloom-causing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum obtusidens under short-term (28 days) exposure. Elevated temperature was the most dominant stressor affecting P. obtusidens at physiological and transcriptomic levels. It significantly increased cell growth rate and maximum photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), but reduced chlorophyll a , particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, and particulate organic phosphorus. Elevated temperature also interacted with other stressors to produce synergistic positive effects on cell growth and Fv/Fm. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that elevated temperature promoted energy production by enhancing glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and nitrogen and carbon assimilation, which supported rapid cell growth but reduced material storage. Increased p CO 2 enhanced the expression of genes involved in ionic acid-base regulation and oxidative stress resistance, whereas a high N:P ratio inhibited photosynthesis, compromising cell viability, although the effect was alleviated by elevated temperature. The combined effect of these multiple stressors resulted in increased energy metabolism and up-regulation of material-synthesis pathways compared to the effect caused by elevated temperature alone. Our results underscore ocean warming as the predominant stressor for dinoflagellates and highlight the complex, synergistic effects of multi-stressors on dinoflagellates.","2024-11-20","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","952","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001308620600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","ACIDIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COCCOLITHOPHORE; COMMUNITY; DONGHAIENSE LU; EUTROPHICATION; Global change; Harmful algal bloom; LIMITATION; Marine dinoflagellates; Multi-stressors; PHOSPHORUS; PHOTOPHYSIOLOGY; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; Prorocentrum obtusidens; Transcriptomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, little is known about how future climate scenarios will affect the growth of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, which is responsible for the paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) events that threaten the health and economy of coastal communities in the Gulf of Maine and elsewhere. The growth responses of A. catenella and two other naturally co-occurring dinoflagellates in the Gulf of Maine-Scrippsiella sp., and Amphidinium carterae-were studied in mono and mixed species cultures. Experimental treatments tested the effects of elevated temperature (20 degrees C), lower pH (7.8), and the combination of elevated temperature and lower pH on growth rates relative to those in near-current conditions (15 degrees C; pH 8.1). Growth rates of A. catenella decreased under elevated temperature and' lower pH conditions, a response that was largely attributable to the effect of temperature. In contrast, growth rates of Scrippsiella sp. and A. carterae increased under elevated temperature and lower pH conditions, with temperature, also .being the primary driver of the response. These trends did not change substantially when these species were grown in mixed cultures (A. catenella + Scrippsiella sp., and A. catenella + A. carterae), indicating that allelopathic or competitive interactions did not affect the experimental outcome under the conditions tested. These findings suggest that A. catenella blooms may become less prevalent in the southern regions of the Gulf of Maine, but potentially more prevalent in the northeastern regions of the Gulf of Maine with continued climate change.","2019-11","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","89","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000496874100016","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;16<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;17<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;62</p>","","","ADAPTATION; Alexandrium; Amphidinium; CARBON ACQUISITION; Climate change; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CO2; DIATOM; FUNDYENSE; Growth rate; Gulf of Maine; HAB; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; Multi-stressor; Ocean acidification; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; PCO(2); PH; Scrippsiella; Temperature; VARIABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the production and transformation dynamics of these compounds under shifting environmental conditions is important for predicting their roles in a changing ocean. Here, we report the physiological and biochemical response of a robust strain of Alexandrium minutum, a dinoflagellate with the highest reported intracellular DMSP content, exposed to a 6 d increase in temperature mimicking mild and extreme coastal marine heatwave conditions (+4 and +12 degrees C). Under mild temperature increases (+4 degrees C), A. minutum growth was enhanced, with no measurable physiological stress response. However, under a very acute increase in temperature (+12 degrees C) triggering thermal stress, A. minutum growth declined, photosynthetic efficiency (F-V/F-M) was impaired, and enhanced oxidative stress was observed. These physiological responses indicative of thermal stress were accompanied by increased DMS and DMSO concentrations followed by decreased DMSP concentration. At this temperature extreme, we observed a cascading stress response in A. minutum, which was initiated 6 h after the start of the experiment by a spike in DMS and DMSO concentrations and a rapid decrease in F-V/F-M. This was followed by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an abrupt decline in DMS and DMSO on day 2 of the experiment. A subsequent decrease in DMSP coupled with a decline in the growth rate of both A. minutum and its associated total bacterial assemblage coincided with a shift in the composition of the A. minutum microbiome. Specifically, an increase in the relative abundance of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) matching Oceanicaulis (17.0 %), Phycisphaeraceae SM1A02 (8.8 %) and Balneola (4.9 %) as well as a decreased relative abundance of Maribacter (24.4 %), Marinoscillum (4.7 %) and Seohaeicola (2.7 %) were primarily responsible for differences in microbiome structure observed between temperature treatments. These shifts in microbiome structure are likely to have been driven by either the temperature itself, the changing physiological state of A. minutum cells, shifts in biogenic sulfur concentrations, the presence of other solutes, or a combination of all. Nevertheless, we suggest that these results point to the significant effect of extreme heatwaves on the physiology, growth and microbiome composition of the redtide causing dinoflagellate A. minutum, as well as potential implications for biogenic sulfur cycling processes and marine DMS emissions.","2019-11-19","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","4377-4391","","22","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000498640300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","ATMOSPHERIC SULFUR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIMETHYLSULFONIOPROPIONATE DMSP CONCENTRATION; DIMETHYLSULFOXIDE DMSO; FORAGING CUE; LYASE ACTIVITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; STRESS; SULFIDE; TEMPERATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cells were grown at low (40 and 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1)), moderate (400 mu E m(-2) s(-1)), and high (800 mu E m(-2) s(-1)) light intensities in a medium with phosphate (P+) and without (P-). Cultures were acclimated to the irradiance conditions for one week, and the experiment was run for similar to 1 month. The cell size and DNA content were monitored via flow cytometry. Two different clonal strains were employed as a monoculture (in a P- or P+ medium) or, to foster sexuality and resting cyst formation, as a mixed culture (only in a P- medium). A. minutum growth was favored by increasing light intensities until 400 mu E m(-2) s(-1). The DNA content analyses indicated the accumulation of S-phase cells at the highest light intensities (400 and 800 mu E m(-2) s(-1)) and therefore the negative effects on cell cycle progression. Only when the cells were grown in a P- medium did higher light intensities trigger dose-dependent, significantly higher toxicities in all the A. minutum cultures. This result suggests that the toxicity level is responsive to the combined effects of (high) light and (low) P stress. The cell size was not significantly affected by the light intensity or P conditions. The optimal light intensity for resting cyst formation was 150 mu E m(-2) s(-1), with higher irradiances reducing the total encystment yield. Encystment was not observed at the lowest light intensity tested, indicative of the key role of low-level irradiance in gamete and/or zygote formation, in contrast to the stressor effect of excessive irradiance on planozygote formation and/or encystment.","2024-07","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","7","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001278392500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","Alexandrium minutum; BLOOMS; DINOPHYCEAE; DYNAMICS; encystment; GROWTH; harmful algal blooms; light; LIGHT; paralytic shellfish poisoning; PHOSPHORUS; PROFILES; pulse amplitude modulation; SALINITY; TEMPERATURE; TOXIN PRODUCTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Competition experiments using these three species were performed under different conditions to determine the dominance of red tide algal species in certain marine environments. Skeletonema costatum outgrew the two dinoflagellates in the silicate-replete medium as a result of its high growth rate. However, the cell density of S. costatum decreased with reduced silicate and changed inorganic carbon availabilities. Skeletonema costatum stopped growing when the inorganic carbon concentration was doubled at a constant pH of 7.7, which may have resulted from the enhanced growth of the two dinoflagellates. Prorocentrum minimum and A. tamarense became dominant at constant pH 7.7 conditions. As a component of the CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM), extracellular carbonic anhydrase (eCA) showed significantly lower activities in S. costatum under low-silicate and constant pH 7.7 conditions; whereas, the P. minimum eCA activity remained almost unaffected. Different eCA responses to reduced silicate and varied carbon sources suggested that the species differed in inorganic carbon acquisition. The results suggested that patterns of species dominance of bloom-forming microalgae may be related to silicate and inorganic carbon availabilities.","2014","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","433-442","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000345112800004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;60</p>","","","ACQUISITION; Alexandrium tamarense; ALEXANDRIUM-TAMARENSE; Carbonic anhydrase; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL; Dissolved inorganic carbon; DYNAMICS; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; NUTRIENT; PH; Prorocentrum minimum; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; Skeletonema costatum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared growth kinetics of P. donghaiense grown on 4 different N substrates (nitrate [NO3-], ammonium [NH4+], urea, and glutamic acid [glu]) with respect to temperature, irradiance, and pCO(2). Temperature (15 to 30 degrees C) had a positive effect on growth (max. growth rates: 0.17 to 0.65 d(-1); optimal temperature: 25 to 30 degrees C); maximum specific growth rates (mu(max)) declined when cultures were grown at 30 degrees C.

The impacts of key environmental factors on the growth, cell yield, cell size and PST content of G. catenatum were determined. Results indicated that increasing salinity from 32 to 39 and nitrate concentrations from 441 mu M to 1764 mu M did not significantly (ANOVA, P-value >0.63) modify the growth rate of the studied species. Gymnodinium catenatum exhibited the highest growth rate at 24 degrees C. Cells arrested their division at 15 degrees C and at ammonium concentration above 441 mu M, suggesting that this nitrogen form is toxic for G. catenatum. Furthermore, G. catenatum was unable to assimilate urea as a nitrogen source. In G. catenatum cells, eight analogues of saxitoxin were detected, belonging to the N-sulfocarbamoyl (C1-4, B1 and B2) and decarbamoyl (dc-GTX2/3) toxins. C-toxins contributed 92 % to 98 % of the molar composition of the PSTs. During the exponential growth, C2 tended to dominate, while C3 prevailed during the stationary phase. Toxin content per cell (ranging from 5.5 pg STXeq.cell(-1) to 22.4 pg STXeq.cell(-1)) increased during the stationary growth phase. Cell toxin content increased with the concentrations of nitrate, ranging from 12.1 pg STXeq.cell(-1) at 441 mu M to 22.4 pg STXeq.cell(-1) at 1764 mu M during the stationary growth phase. The toxin content of G. catenatum showed the highest values measured at the highest tested temperatures, especially during the stationary phase, where toxicity reached 17.8 pg STXeq.cell(-1) and 16.4 pg STXeq.cell(-1) at 24 degrees C and 29 degrees C, respectively.

The dinoflagellate Shimiella gracilenta survives using the plastids of ingested prey, indicating kleptoplastidy. However, studies on the effects of water temperature on kleptoplastidic dinoflagellates are lacking. We explored the growth and ingestion rates of S. gracilenta as a function of water temperature. Furthermore, using data on its spatiotemporal distribution in Korean coastal waters during 2015-2018, we predicted its distribution under elevated temperature conditions of +2, +4, and +6 degrees C. Growth rates of S. gracilenta with and without Teleaulax amphioxeia prey as well as ingestion rates were significantly affected by water temperature. Growth rates of S. gracilenta with and without prey were positive or zero at 5-25 degrees C but were negative at >= 30 degrees C. The maximum growth rate of S. gracilenta with T. amphioxeia was 0.85 d(-1), achieved at 25 degrees C, and 0.21 d(-1) at 20 degrees C without prey. The ingestion rate of S. gracilenta on T. amphioxeia at 25 degrees C (0.05 ng C predator(-1) d(-1)) was greater than that at 20 degrees C (0.04 ng C predator(-1) d(-1)). Thus, feeding may shift the optimal temperature for the maximum growth rate of S. gracilenta from 20 to 25 degrees C. In spring and winter, the distributions of S. gracilenta under elevated temperature conditions were predicted not to differ from those during 2015-2018. However, S. gracilenta was predicted not to survive at some additional stations under elevated temperature conditions of +2, +4, and +6 degrees C in summer or under elevated temperature conditions of +6 degrees C in autumn.

Despite laboratory experiments indicating pH effects on algal growth, little is understood about how acidification affects HABs in estuaries that typically feature strong horizontal and vertical gradients in pH and other carbonate chemistry parameters. Here, coupled hydrodynamic-carbonate chemistry-HAB models were developed to gain a better understanding of OA effects on a high biomass HAB in a eutrophic estuary and to project how the global anthropogenic CO2 increase might affect these HABs in the future climate. Prorocentrum minimum in Chesapeake bay, USA, one of the most common HAB species in estuarine waters, was used as an example for studying the OA effects on HABs. Laboratory data on P. minimum grown under different pH conditions were applied in the development of an empirical formula relating growth rate to pH. Hindcast simulation using the coupled hydrodynamic-carbonate chemistry-HAB models showed that the P. minimum blooms were enhanced in the upper bay where pH was low. On the other hand, pH effects on P. minimum growth in the mid and lower bay with higher pH were minimal, but model simulations show surface seaward estuarine flow exported the higher biomass in the upper bay downstream. Future model projections with higher atmospheric pCO(2) show that the bay-wide averaged P. minimum concentration during the bloom periods increases by 2.9% in 2050 and 6.2% in 2100 as pH decreases and 0.2 or 0.4, respectively. Overall the model results suggest OA will cause a moderate amplification of P. minimum blooms in Chesapeake bay. The coupled modeling framework developed here can be applied to study the effects of OA on other HAB species in estuarine and coastal environments.","2022-07-04","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000828350900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;84</p>","","","ANTHROPOGENIC CO2; Chesapeake bay; CHESAPEAKE BAY; climate change; CO2 CONCENTRATING MECHANISMS; DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROWTH; harmful algal bloom; IMPACTS; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; numerical model; ocean acidification; pH; Prorocentrum minimum; SURFACE OCEAN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anthropogenic pressures like eutrophication may increase the frequency and intensity of these phenomena. The Black Sea is characterized by rapid changes in salinity and temperature in surface waters. In addition, it has suffered increasing environmental pressure from human activities. This work presents the first cultures of Gymnodinium aureolum to be isolated from the Black Sea. Morphological and phylogenetic analyses confirmed our strain as G. aureolum. The effects of temperature and salinity on growth were tested in experiments combining two temperatures and five salinities in 10 experimental treatments. This provides baseline data on the physiological adaption and acclimatization potential of the species to bloom under present and future climatic scenarios in the Black Sea. Gymnodinium aureolum grew exponentially in all experimental treatments, except for cultures at salinity 5. Growth rate increased significantly with increasing temperature reaching the maximum at 20 degrees C and salinity 15 (0.38 +/- 0.02 d(-1)). This suggests an adaptation to the salinity and temperature of Black Sea waters and, together with previous records of G. aureolum in both water and sediments, supports the idea that this may be a bloom-forming population of G. aureolum.","2021","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","201-210","","3","64","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000660531300004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;65</p>","","","algal bloom; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL WATERS; dinoflagellate culture; DINOPHYCEAE; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; growth rate; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; MIKIMOTOI; NITROGEN; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; phylogeny; PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a critical question, as dissolution of anthropogenic CO2 emissions into seawater is leading to progressively lower pH values, or ocean acidification. Sea surface temperatures are concurrently increasing, a trend that is also projected to continue in the future. We conditioned a clonal culture of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxin producing Alexandrium catenella (A-11c) isolated from coastal Southern California to factorial combinations of two temperatures, two pCO(2) levels, and two phosphate concentrations for a period of eight months. Interactions between these variables influenced growth and carbon fixation rates and although these treatments only elicited minor differences in toxin profile, total cellular toxicity was dramatically affected. Cells conditioned to high pCO(2) (levels projected for year 2075) and low phosphate at low temperature (15 degrees C) were the most toxic, while lower pCO(2), higher phosphate levels, and warmer temperature (19 degrees C) alleviated this toxicity to varying degrees. Overall increased pCO(2) generally led to enhanced potency. Our results suggest that future increased ocean acidification may exacerbate the toxic threat posed by this toxic dinoflagellate, especially when combined with nutrient limitation, but that future warmer temperatures could also offset some of this enhanced toxicity.

But how this change impacts phytoplankton in coastal, particularly harmful algal blooms (HABs), remains poorly understood. Here, we monitored a coastal bay for a decade and found a significant correlation between salinity decline and the increase of Karenia mikimotoi blooms. To examine the physiological linkage between salinity decreases and K. mikimotoi blooms, we compare chemical, physiological and multi-omic profiles of this species in laboratory cultures under high (33) and low (25) salinities. Under low salinity, photosynthetic efficiency and capacity as well as growth rate and cellular protein content were significantly higher than that under high salinity. More strikingly, the omics data show that low salinity activated the glyoxylate shunt to bypass the decarboxylation reaction in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, hence redirecting carbon from CO2 release to biosynthesis. Furthermore, the enhanced glyoxylate cycle could promote hydrogen peroxide metabolism, consistent with the detected decrease in reactive oxygen species. These findings suggest that salinity declines can reprogram metabolism to enhance cell proliferation, thus promoting bloom formation in HAB species like K. mikimotoi, which has important ecological implications for future climate-driven salinity declines in the coastal ocean with respect to HAB outbreaks.","2024-06","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","6","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001236534300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;64</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; DINOFLAGELLATE; global climate change; harmful algal bloom; Karenia mikimotoi; KARENIA-MIKIMOTOI; LIGHT-INTENSITY; METABOLISM; OCEAN; PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS; ROS; salinity; TEMPERATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For both species, the high-P (HP) concentration group showed the greatest algal density and highest specific growth rate. Changes in the maximum efficiency of photosystem II (F (v) /F (m) ) were monitored under the various P and N/P conditions. The largest decrease in F (v) /F (m) was in the low-P (LP) group in S. costatum and in the HP group in P. donghaiense. There were high rapid light curves and photochemical quantum yields (I broken vertical bar (PSII)) for S. costatum in the HP group, while the actual photosynthetic capacity was higher in P. donghaiense than in S. costatum in the MP group. Under eutrophic but relatively P-restricted conditions, P. donghaiense had higher photosynthetic activity and potential, which could cause this dinoflagellate to increasingly dominate the phytoplankton community in these conditions. Under the same P concentration and N/P ratio, P. donghaiense had a larger relative maximum rate of electron transport and higher I broken vertical bar (PS II) values than those of S. costatum. These differences between P. donghaiense and S. costatum may explain the interaction and succession patterns of these two species in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River estuary from a photosynthesis perspective.","2016-11","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","1158-1172","","6","34","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000382885200002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;56</p>","","","algae growth; BLOOM; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; COASTAL; EAST CHINA SEA; IRRADIANCE; LIMITATION; NITROGEN; nutrients; PHOTOINHIBITION; photosynthetic characteristics; PHYTOPLANKTON; Prorocentrum donghaiense; Skeletonema costatum; YANGTZE-RIVER ESTUARY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The non-bloom community was dominated by diatoms whereas during the bloom it was dominated by the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum shikokuense (formerly P. donghaiense). P. shikokuense rRNA abundance and rRNA:rRNA gene ratio both increased markedly in the bloom, indicating that the bloom arose from active growth. In contrast, some non-bloom species showed low DNA abundances during the bloom albeit high rRNA:rRNA gene ratios, suggesting that cell loss processes such as grazing might have prevented these species from blooming or that these species might be at an early stage of bloom development.

This study assessed the bloom's physiological state, by analyzing its cell abundance, cell size, toxin content and DNA content, as well as how those cell parameters evolved in time. While toxicity decreased over time, cell size remained constant. DNA content analysis revealed a scarcity of sexual stages and a decline in mitotic growth rate between the two dates. Nine months later, 39 sediment samples were analyzed for resting cyst deposition, showing highly variable distribution. The highest cyst concentrations were at the bloom initiation site and the farthest sampling point. Generally low cyst deposition values aligned with the low number of sexual stages detected in the bloom samples analyzed. To estimate the intrinsic potential for sexuality of the bloom, i.e., that shown under conditions specifically designed to induce cyst formation 43 strains from different bloom locations were isolated and mixed in all possible combinations of pairs (945 crosses). Sexual reproduction occurred in 86.46 % of the crosses, but with low compatibility indices (CI = 0.10-0.88, AV = 1.50-2.55, RC = 0.14-2.12). The low intrinsic potential for sexuality of the bloom, was coincident with all previous sexual aspects analyzed in the bloom subsamples, an aspect which may relate to a bloom with low genetic variability.

In laboratory treatments we mimicked salinity conditions at the edge of the mesohaline south-eastern Baltic and oligohaline-to-limnic Curonian Lagoon. We used an innovative computer-based method allowing detection of P. cordatum cells and quantitative characterization of cell contours in phytoplankton images. This method also made available robust indicators of the morphometric changes, which are not accessible for an expert studying cells under light microscope. We found that the salinity tolerance limit of P. cordatum ranges between 1.8 and 3.6, and that the mean cell size of its population is inversely proportional to both salinity and nutrient content. Under ambient south-eastern Baltic salinity (7.2) the nutrients were stimulating the growth of P. cordatum; while at the edge of its salinity tolerance the nutrient availability did not have such effect. We suggest that in the future Baltic the decline in salinity and increase in nutrient loads may result in larger cells of P. cordatum and extended duration of their presence in plankton, causing longer periods of algal blooms.

Macroalgae have a sublethal effect on corals that includes the inhibition of their growth, development, and reproduction. Thus, this study explored the effects of the macroalga, Caulerpa taxifolia, on the massive coral, Turbinaria peltata, under thermal stress. We compared the responses of the corals' water-meditated interaction with algae (the co-occurrence group) and those in direct contact with algae at two temperatures. The results show that after co-culturing with C. taxifolia for 28 days, the density content of the dinoflagellate endosymbionts was significantly influenced by the presence of C. taxifolia at ambient temperature (27 degrees C), from 1.3 x 106 cells cm-2 in control group to 0.95 x 106 cells cm-2 in the co-occurrence group and to 0.89 x 106 cells cm-2 in the direct contact group. The chlorophyll a concentration only differed significantly between the control and the direct contact group at 27 degrees C. The protein content of T. peltata decreased by 37.2% in the co-occurrence group and 49.0% in the direct contact group compared to the control group. Meanwhile, the growth rate of T. peltata decreased by 57.7% in the co-occurrence group and 65.5% in the direct contact group compared to the control group. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes significantly increased, and there was a stronger effect of direct coral contact with C. taxifolia than the co-occurrence group. At 30 degrees C, the endosymbiont density, chlorophyll a content, and growth rate of T. peltata significantly decreased compared to the control temperature; the same pattern was seen in the increase in antioxidant enzyme activity. Additionally, when the coral was co-cultured with macroalgae at 30 degrees C, there was no significant decrease in the density or chlorophyll a content of the endosymbiont compared to the control. However, the interaction of macroalgae and elevated temperature was evident in the feeding rate, protein content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity compared to the control group. The direct contact of the coral with macroalga had a greater impact than water-meditated interactions.

The edible mussel Mytilus chilensis is a common calcifier inhabiting marine ecosystems of the southern Chile, where culturing of this species is concentrated and where algal blooms produced by the toxic dinoflagellate A. catenella are becoming more frequent. Juvenile Mytilus chilensis were exposed to experimental conditions simulating two environmental phenomena: pCO(2) increase and the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) produced by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Individuals were exposed to two levels of pCO(2): 380 mu atm (control condition) and 1000 mu atm (future conditions) over a period of 39 days (acclimation), followed by another period of 40 days exposure to a combination of pCO(2) and PST. Both factors significantly affected most of the physiological variables measured (feeding, metabolismand scope for growth). However, these effects greatly varied over time, which can be explained by the high individual variability described formussels exposed to different environmental conditions. Absorption efficiency was not affected by the independent effect of the toxic diet; however, the diet and pCO(2) interaction affected it significantly. The inhibition of the physiological processes related with energy acquisition by diets containing PST, may negatively impact mussel fitness, which could have important consequences for both wild and cultured mussel populations, and thus, for socioeconomic development in southern Chile.

The effect of salinity on these species was tested under acclimated conditions and abrupt salinity changes. Cultures were acclimated for one month (S 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35), and the optimum growth was established. The acclimated cultures that presented optimal growth were transferred, without acclimation, to higher and lower salinities. A. sanguinea showed maximum growth at salinity 25 with a broad tolerance (S 10-35), and carrying capacity was highest and lowest at salinities of 30 and 10, respectively. P. micans grew better and had a higher carrying capacity at a higher salinity (25-35). The response of cells to salinity variation was also species-specific: no change (P. micans) or an increased growth rate (A. sanguinea). In the surf zone of Cassino Beach, both species had higher frequency and cell density in summer and autumn. The relationship between salinity and cell density coincided with the results obtained in the laboratory. The ability to grow under salinity changes is an important mechanism that leads to dinoflagellate blooms. With the increasing rainfall in southern Brazil as a result of climate change, A. sanguinea will likely be more successful than P. micans and form blooms in this region, due to its broad range of salinity tolerance.","2015","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","965-973","","9","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000362342500007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","acclimation; ALEXANDRIUM-TAMARENSE; AMINO-ACIDS; BAY; BLOOMS; DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION; dinoflagellate growth; DIVERSITY; IRRADIANCE; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; PHYTOPLANKTON COMPOSITION; Salinity; TEMPERATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to effects of temperature and eutrophication, recent research has shed new light on the possible implications of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Depletion of dissolved CO2 by dense cyanobacterial blooms creates a concentration gradient across the air-water interface. A steeper gradient at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations will lead to a greater influx of CO2, which can be intercepted by surface-dwelling blooms, thus intensifying cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria display an unexpected diversity in CO2 responses, because different strains combine their uptake systems for CO2 and bicarbonate in different ways. The genetic composition of cyanobacterial blooms may therefore shift. In particular, strains with high-flux carbon uptake systems may benefit from the anticipated rise in inorganic carbon availability. Increasing temperatures also stimulate cyanobacterial growth. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria and also green algae have temperature optima above 25 degrees C, often exceeding the temperature optima of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Analysis of published data suggests that the temperature dependence of the growth rate of cyanobacteria exceeds that of green algae. Indirect effects of elevated temperature, like an earlier onset and longer duration of thermal stratification, may also shift the competitive balance in favor of buoyant cyanobacteria while eukaryotic algae are impaired by higher sedimentation losses. Furthermore, cyanobacteria differ from eukaryotic algae in that they can fix dinitrogen, and new insights show that the nitrogen-fixation activity of heterocystous cyanobacteria can be strongly stimulated at elevated temperatures. Models and lake studies indicate that the response of cyanobacterial growth to rising CO2 concentrations and elevated temperatures can be suppressed by nutrient limitation. The greatest response of cyanobacterial blooms to climate change is therefore expected to occur in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers attribute this to environmental changes such as rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Such addition of carbon into the ocean ecosystem can lead to increased growth, enhanced metabolism, and altered toxicity of toxic phytoplankton communities resulting in serious human health concerns. In this study, the effects of elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) on the growth and toxicity of a strain of Alexandrium tamarense (ATDH) widespread in the East and South China Seas were investigated. Results of these studies showed a higher specific growth rate (0.31 +/- 0.05 day(-1)) when exposed to 1000 mu atm CO2, (experimental), with a corresponding density of (2.02 +/- 0.19) x 10(7) cells L-1, that was significantly larger than cells under 395 mu atm CO2(control). These data also revealed that elevated pCO(2) primarily affected the photosynthetic properties of cells in the exponential growth phase. Interestingly, measurement of the total toxin content per cell was reduced by half under elevated CO2 conditions. The following individual toxins were measured in this study: Cl, C2, GTX1, GTX2, GTX3, GTX4, GTX5, STX, dcGTX2, dcGTX3, and dcSTX. Cells grown in 1000 mu atm CO2 showed an overall decrease in the cellular concentrations of Cl, C2, GTX2, GTX3, GTX5, STX, dcGTX2, dcGTX3, and dcSTX, but an increase in GTX1 and GTX4. Total cellular toxicity per cell was measured revealing an increase of nearly 60% toxicity in the presence of elevated CO2 compared to controls.

Among the most sensitive taxa to these changes are scleractinian corals, which engineer the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Corals' sensitivity is a consequence of their evolutionary investment in symbiosis with the dinoflagellate alga, Symbiodinium. Together, the coral holobiont has dominated oligotrophic tropical marine habitats. However, warming destabilizes this association and reduces coral fitness. It has been theorized that, when reefs become warm and eutrophic, mutualistic Symbiodinium sequester more resources for their own growth, thus parasitizing their hosts of nutrition. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sub- bleaching temperature and excess nitrogen promotes symbiont parasitism by measuring respiration (costs) and the assimilation and translocation of both carbon (energy) and nitrogen (growth; both benefits) within Orbicella faveolata hosting one of two Symbiodinium phylotypes using a dual stable isotope tracer incubation at ambient (26 degrees C) and sub- bleaching (31 degrees C) temperatures under elevated nitrate. Warming to 31 degrees C reduced holobiont net primary productivity (NPP) by 60% due to increased respiration which decreased host % carbon by 15% with no apparent cost to the symbiont. Concurrently, Symbiodinium carbon and nitrogen assimilation increased by 14 and 32%, respectively while increasing their mitotic index by 15%, whereas hosts did not gain a proportional increase in translocated photosynthates. We conclude that the disparity in benefits and costs to both partners is evidence of symbiont parasitism in the coral symbiosis and has major implications for the resilience of coral reefs under threat of global change.","2018-03","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","921-930","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000427226100024","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;187<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;209<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;49</p>","","","ALGAL SYMBIONTS; BLEACHING EVENT; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; POPULATION-DENSITY; REEF CORALS; SEAWATER TEMPERATURE; STYLOPHORA-PISTILLATA; SYMBIODINIUM; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Habitat warming associated with anthropogenic climate change has detrimentally impacted marine primary production, with the effects observed on regional and global scales. In contrast to slower-growing higher plants, there is considerable potential for phytoplankton to evolve rapidly with changing environmental conditions. The energetic constraints associated with adaptation in phytoplankton are not yet understood, but are central to forecasting how global biogeochemical cycles respond to contemporary ocean change. Here, we demonstrate a number of potential trade-offs associated with high-temperature adaptation in a tropical microbial eukaryote, Amphidinium massartii (dinoflagellate). Most notably, the population became high-temperature specialized (higher fitness within a narrower thermal envelope and higher thermal optimum), and had a greater nutrient requirement for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Evidently, the energetic constraints associated with living at elevated temperature alter competiveness along other environmental gradients. While high-temperature adaptation led to an irreversible change in biochemical composition (i.e., an increase in fatty acid saturation), the mechanisms underpinning thermal evolution in phytoplankton remain unclear, and will be crucial to understanding whether the trade-offs observed here are species-specific or are representative of the evolutionary constraints in all phytoplankton.","2018-12","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","799-810","","6","54","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000454908500005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;24<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;68</p>","","","ACID; adaptation; ADAPTATION; ALGAE; CHLOROPHYLL-A; COCCOLITHOPHORE; global warming; LIGHT; MODEL; phytoplankton; PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH; SYMBIODINIUM; TEMPERATURE; thermal niche; thermal performance curves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies examining BVOC emissions have predominantly focussed on terrestrial ecosystems and atmospheric chemistry - surprisingly, highly productive marine ecosystems remain largely overlooked. Here we examined the volatilome (total BVOCs) of the microalgal endosymbionts of reef invertebrates, Symbiodiniaceae. We used GC-MS to characterise five species (Symbiodinium linucheae, Breviolum psygmophilum, Durusdinium trenchii, Effrenium voratum, Fugacium kawagutii) under steady-state growth. A diverse range of 32 BVOCs were detected (from 12 in D. trenchii to 27 in S. linucheae) with halogenated hydrocarbons, alkanes and esters the most common chemical functional groups. A thermal stress experiment on thermally-sensitive Cladocopium goreaui and thermally-tolerant D. trenchii significantly affected the volatilomes of both species. More BVOCs were detected in D. trenchii following thermal stress (32 degrees C), while fewer BVOCs were recorded in stressed C. goreaui. The onset of stress caused dramatic increases of dimethyl-disulfide (98.52%) in C. goreaui and nonanoic acid (99.85%) in D. trenchii. This first volatilome analysis of Symbiodiniaceae reveals that both species-specificity and environmental factors govern the composition of BVOC emissions among the Symbiodiniaceae, which potentially have, as yet unexplored, physiological and ecological importance in shaping coral reef community functioning.","2019-11-22","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000498056900021","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;29<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;31<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","DIMETHYL SULFIDE; DIMETHYLSULFONIOPROPIONATE; DINOFLAGELLATE; DMSP; HOST; ISOPRENE; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; ORGANIC-COMPOUND EMISSIONS; VOC; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

K. brevis strains have previously shown to be sensitive to changes in CO2, both in terms of growth as well as toxin production. Our study aimed to understand this sensitivity by measuring underlying mechanisms, such as photosynthesis, carbon acquisition, and photo physiology. K. brevis (CCFWC-126) did not show a significant response in growth, cellular composition of carbon and nitrogen, nor in photosynthetic rates between pCO(2) concentrations of 150, 400, or 780 mu atm. However, a strong response in its acquisition of inorganic carbon was found. Half saturation values for CO2 increased from 1.5 to 3.3 mu M, inorganic carbon preference switched from HCO3- to CO2 (14-56% CO2 usage), and external carbonic anhydrase activity was downregulated by 23% when comparing low and high pCO(2). We conclude that K. brevis must employ an efficient and regulated CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) to maintain constant carbon fixation and growth across pCO(2) levels. No statistically significant correlation between CO2 and breve toxin content was found, yet a positive trend with enhanced pCO(2) was detected. This study is the first explaining how this socioeconomically important species is able to efficiently supply inorganic carbon for photosynthesis, which can potentially prolong bloom situations. This study also highlights that elevated CO2 concentrations, as projected for a future ocean, can affect underlying physiological processes of K. brevis, some of which could lead to increases in cellular brevetoxin production and therefore increased impacts on coastal ecosystems and economies.","2019-03","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","65-76","","","172","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000460493500005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;88</p>","","","ACID; Acidification (RT pH); BLOOM; BREVETOXIN; Carbon concentrating mechanism; Carbon fixation (RT photosynthesis); Climate change; CO2-CONCENTRATING MECHANISMS; EMILIANIA-HUXLEYI; Florida; FLORIDA; GROWTH-RATE; Gulf of Mexico; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; Neurotoxins; Red tides (RT Algal Blooms); Regional USA; REPETITION RATE FLUOROMETRY; SEAWATER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This review focuses on the role of algae harbored inside corals in mitigating against heat stress effect and maintaining the symbiosis with regards to its different action mechanisms. Physiological models revealed the role of nitrogen fixing bacteria, i.e., diazotrophs in bleached corals that can either diazotrophically-derived nitrogen allows corals to better withstand bleaching, or increases bleaching by generating unbalanced nutrient requirements that lead to phosphorus starvation in Symbiodinium. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by symbiosis operation of the damaged photosynthetic machinery causes leaks in the host cell, where they overpower cellular antioxidant mechanisms and potentially damage the host tissue. Both symbiotic partners, however, have significant adaptations for managing ROS to mitigate against cell damage as discussed in this review. Such extensive compile of literature suggest that physiological host plasticity and/or symbiotic components clearly plays a significant role in response to thermal stress that may also vary between different species of corals, as many corals may contain specific ecotypes or clades of zooxanthellae which may vary in their ability to withstand thermal stress.","2022-09","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000867441600005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;215</p>","","","Algae endosymbionts; Climate change; DINOFLAGELLATE ALGA; FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; MEMBRANE-LIPIDS; Microalgae; MONTIPORA-DIGITATA; NITRIC-OXIDE; Oxidative stress; OXIDATIVE STRESS; SYMBIODINIUM-MICROADRIATICUM; SYMBIOTIC ALGAE; THERMAL-STRESS; Zooxanthellae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The autotrophic and mixotrophic growth and ingestion rates of Biecheleria cincta BCSH1005 feeding on the suitable prey raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo at 5-35 degrees C were determined.

The distributions of B. cincta under + 2, + 4, and + 6 degrees C water temperature conditions were predicted using the results of field observations. At all tested water temperatures, B. cincta did not grow autotrophically. However, B. cincta grew mixotrophically by feeding on H. akashiwo at 15-25 degrees C, with a maximum growth rate of 0.26 day-1 at 25 degrees C, but B. cincta did not grow at lower or higher temperatures.

Currently, there is a significant decrease in the contribution of small diatom species (Skeletonema sp. and Chaetoceros socialis H.S.Lauder as well as coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) W.W.Hay and H.P.Mohler) to the total phytoplankton biomass in these waters. Previously these species caused regular weak blooms. In the warm periods (from May to October), during which the main phytoplankton biomass is formed, large diatom species Pseudosolenia calcar-avis (Schultze) B.G.Sundstrom, 1986, Proboscia alata (Brightwell) Sundstrom and dinoflagellates predominate. Therefore, the maximum values of the phytoplankton community's specific growth rate are about two times lower than in the preceding periods and do not exceed 1.10-1.40 day(-1). There was also a decrease observed in the microzooplankton grazing rate, which, during the year, was no higher than 0.70-1.20 day(-1). This is primarily conditioned by the increased role of large algae in phytoplankton, which means a decline in nutrition quality for microzooplankton. As a result of the joint influence of nutrition quality and water pollution, the relative share of net primary production consumed by microzooplankton in the warm periods of the year averaged only 32%, which is two times lower than the average values generally accepted for marine ecosystems. This means that the transfer of matter and energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels is significantly decreased.","2021-11","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","22","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000724793800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;24</p>","","","anthropogenic pressure; Black Sea; climatic changes; DIATOMS; microzooplankton grazing; phytoplankton; phytoplankton growth rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reef-building corals form symbiotic relationships with dinoflagellates (family Symbiodiniaceae), including those species which acquire their initial symbiont complement predominately from their parents. Changes in the composition of symbiont communities, through the mechanisms of symbiont shuffling or switching, can modulate the host's thermal limits. However, the role of shuffling in coral acclimatization to heat is understudied in coral offspring and to date has largely focused on the adults. To quantify potential fitness benefits and consequences of changes in symbiont communities under a simulated heatwave in coral early life-history stages, we exposed larvae and juveniles of the widespread, vertically transmitting coral, Montipora digitata, to heat stress (32 degrees C) and tracked changes in their growth, survival, photosynthetic efficiency, and symbiont community composition over time relative to controls. We found negative impacts from warming in all fitness-related traits, which varied significantly among larval families and across life-history stages. Larvae that survived heat exposure exhibited changes in symbiont communities that favored symbionts that are canonically more stress tolerant. Compared to larvae, juveniles showed more rapid mortality under heat stress and their symbiont communities were largely fixed regardless of temperature treatment, suggesting an inability to alter their symbiont community as an acclimatory response to heat stress. Taken together, these findings suggest that capacity for symbiont shuffling may be modified through ontogeny, and that the juvenile life stage may be less flexible and more at risk from climate warming in this species.","2025-01","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001396053200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","coral reefs; ENDOSYMBIONTS; EVOLUTION; FLEXIBILITY; heat stress; RADIATION; REEF; SENSITIVITY; Symbiodiniaceae; SYMBIODINIUM; symbiosis; TEMPERATURE; TOLERANCE; transgenerational acclimatization; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand the origin of the bloom and determine the potential for blooms in subsequent years, water and sediment samples collected in the Taiwan Strait from 2016 to 2019 were analyzed for cells and cysts using light microscopy (LM) and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The morphology of both cells and cysts from the field and cultures was examined with LM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Large subunit (LSU) and/or internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-5.8S rRNA gene sequences were obtained in 13 isolates from bloom samples and five strains from cysts. In addition, cells of strains TIO523 and GCLY02 (from the Taiwan Strait and Yellow Sea of China, respectively) were subjected to growth experiments, and cysts from the field were used for germination experiments under various temperatures. Our strains shared identical LSU and ITS-5.8S rRNA gene sequences with those from other parts of the world, and therefore belonged to a global population. A low abundance of G. catenatum cells were detected during most of the sampling period, but a small bloom was encountered in Quanzhou on June 8, 2018. Few cysts were observed in 2016 but a marked increase was observed after the bloom in 2017, with a highest density of 689 cysts cm(-3). Cysts germinated at temperatures between 14 and 23 degrees C with a final germination rate over 93%. Strains TIO523 and GCLY02 displayed growth at temperatures between 17 and 26 degrees C and 14 and 26 degrees C, respectively, with both strains displaying the highest growth rate of ca. 0.5 divisions d(-1) at 23 degrees C. The PSTs of the three strains and cysts from the sediments were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). All strains were able to produce PSTs, which were dominated by N-sulfocarbamoyl C toxins (C1/2, 53.0-143.5 pg cell(-1)) and decarbamoyl gonyautoxins (dcGTX2/3, 26.7-52.1 pg cell(-1)), although they were not detected in cysts. However, hydroxybenzoyl (GC) toxins were detected in both cells and cysts.

This close relationship is disrupted when seawater temperature increases, causing coral bleaching eventually affecting entire coral reefs. Although the relationship between animal host and photosymbiont has been well-studied, little is known about the bacterial community associated with Symbiodiniaceae in culture. We compared the microbial communities of three isolates from different species of the genus Symbiodinium (formerly known as Symbiodinium clade A) with different ecophysiology, levels of interaction with the animal host, and thermal adaptations. Two species, Symbiodinium microadriaticum and Symbiodinium necroappettens, exhibit intermediate thermotolerance, with a decrease of both growth rate and photochemical efficiency with increased temperature. The third species, Symbiodinium pilosum, has high thermotolerance with no difference in growth rate or photochemical efficiency at 32 degrees C. Microbial communities were characterized after 27 days of growth under control (26 degrees C) and high temperature (32 degrees C). Data shows stronger grouping of bacterial assemblages based on Symbiodinium species than temperature. Microbial communities did not group phylogenetically. We found a shared set of fifteen ASVs belonging to four genera and three families that remained in all three Symbiodiniaceae species. These included Labrenzia, Phycisphaeraceae (SM1A02), Roseovarius, and Muricauda, which are all commonly associated with corals and Symbiodiniaceae cultures. Few ASVs differed significantly by temperature within species. S. pilosum displayed significantly lower levels of microbial diversity and greater individual variability in community composition at 32 degrees C compared to 26 degrees C. These results suggest that bacteria associated or co-cultured with thermotolerant Symbiodinium might play an important role in thermotolerance. Further research on the functional metabolic pathways of these bacteria might hold the key to understanding Symbiodinium's ability to tolerate thermal stress.","2022-05-19","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000806050900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;89</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL SURFACE MUCUS; DINOFLAGELLATE; holobiont; METAGENOMIC ANALYSIS; MICROADRIATICUM FREUDENTHAL; microbial communities; microbiome; MICROBIOME; PATTERNS; photosymbionts; REEF CORAL; SP-NOV; thermotolerance; ZOOXANTHELLA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The phytoplankton species composition has remained relatively the same during recent years compared to the end of the last century and the beginning of the 2000s. However, significant changes have occurred in the ratio between different species of diatoms, and the proportion of dinoflagellates was increased, especially in the autumn. Large diatoms and dinoflagellates play a crucial role in forming the phytoplankton biomass seasonal peaks. The first central maximum was observed in July, and the second smaller one was in September-November.

These blooms have variable toxicity which may be related to bloom stage and in situ growth rates of the constituent K. veneficum cells. Measurement of in situ growth rates is challenging and methods such as the mitotic index technique require knowledge of the dynamics of cell division. In order to better understand these dynamics, we determined the duration of cell division (td) in four geographically distinct laboratory strains of K. veneficum at three different environmentally relevant temperatures. The results demonstrated that the td value for each strain, growing at strain-specific optimal temperatures, was 1.6 +/- 0.1 h. This value corresponded to a range of growth rates from 0.17 +/- 0.08 d-1 to 0.62 +/- 0.07 d-1. Equivalent values of td spread across four geographically distinct laboratory strains and a nearly fourfold range of growth rates implies that 1.6 h represents the td value of K. veneficum. Additionally, temperature conditions yielding this value for td and the highest growth rates varied among strains, indicating cold-adapted (Norway), warm-adapted (Florida, USA), and eurythermally-adapted (Maryland, USA) strains. These differences have been apparently retained in culture over many years, indicating a conserved genetic basis that suggests distinct thermal ecotypes of the morphospecies K. veneficum. This knowledge together with the first estimate of td for K. veneficum will be useful in future field studies aimed at correlating bloom toxicity with in situ growth rate using the mitotic index technique.","2024-01","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","131","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001138177800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;53</p>","","","Cell cycle; CELL-CYCLE; CHESAPEAKE-BAY; Cytokinesis; DIEL; Dinoflagellate; DINOFLAGELLATE; DINOPHYCEAE; Duration of mitosis; Ecotype; GYMNODINIUM-GALATHEANUM; Harmful algal bloom; In situ growth rate; Karlodinium veneficum; Mitotic index; PATTERNS; PHYTOPLANKTON; POPULATIONS; RATES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in diatoms and dinoflagellates are thought to be one of the possible mechanisms for the increase in harmful algal blooms (HABs), due to changing hydrological conditions associated with climate change and human activities. However, little is known about their ability to adapt to changing ocean environments, thus making it difficult to know whether and how they are adapting. By analyzing a 44-year monitoring dataset in the central Bohai Sea during 1978-2021, we found that the abundance ratio of diatoms to dinoflagellates showed a decreasing trend seasonally and ecologically, indicating that the phytoplankton community underwent distinct successional processes from diatom dominance to diatomdinoflagellate co-dominance. These processes exhibited varying responses to temperature, nutrient concentrations and ratios, and their interactions, of which temperature primarily drove the seasonal succession whereas nutrients were responsible for the ecological succession. Specifically, diatoms showed a preference for lower temperatures and higher DIP concentrations, and were able to tolerate lower DIN at lower temperatures. In contrast, dinoflagellates tended to prevail at conditions of warming and high N/P ratios. These different traits of diatoms and dinoflagellates reflected the fact that warming as a result of rising temperature and eutrophication as a consequence of nutrient input would favor dinoflagellates over diatoms. Moreover, the increasing dominance of dinoflagellates indicated that dinoflagellate blooms were likely to become more frequent and intense in the central Bohai Sea.","2024-06-25","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","931","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001239442800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>","","","Bohai Sea; BOHAI SEA; Diatoms; Dinoflagellates; DISSOLVED ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; DYNAMICS; GROWTH-RATE; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; Nutrient; PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY; RATIOS; RIVER ESTUARY; SEASONAL SUCCESSION; Succession; Temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The comparative role of symbiont type in holobiont fitness in relation to host genotype or the environment, however, is largely unknown. We addressed this knowledge gap by manipulating host-symbiont combinations and comparing growth, survival and thermal tolerance among the resultant holobionts in different environments. Methodology/Principal Findings: Offspring of the coral, Acropora millepora, from two thermally contrasting locations, were experimentally infected with one of six Symbiodinium types, which spanned three phylogenetic clades (A, C and D), and then outplanted to the two parental field locations (central and southern inshore Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Growth and survival of juvenile corals were monitored for 31-35 weeks, after which their thermo-tolerance was experimentally assessed. Our results showed that: (1) Symbiodinium type was the most important predictor of holobiont fitness, as measured by growth, survival, and thermo-tolerance; (2) growth and survival, but not heat-tolerance, were also affected by local environmental conditions; and (3) host population had little to no effect on holobiont fitness. Furthermore, coral-algal associations were established with symbiont types belonging to clades A, C and D, but three out of four symbiont types belonging to clade C failed to establish a symbiosis. Associations with clade A had the lowest fitness and were unstable in the field. Lastly, Symbiodinium types C1 and D were found to be relatively thermo-tolerant, with type D conferring the highest tolerance in A. millepora. Conclusions/Significance: These results highlight the complex interactions that occur between the coral host, the algal symbiont, and the environment to shape the fitness of the coral holobiont. An improved understanding of the factors affecting coral holobiont fitness will assist in predicting the responses of corals to global climate change.","2009-07-24","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","7","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000268318900007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;148<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;174<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among other combinations of stressors, the impact of trace metal toxicity on marine phytoplankton under the ocean acidification scenario is an important aspect to address. Such multiple stressor studies are rare from the Arabian Sea, one of the highest productive oceanic provinces within the North Indian Ocean. We studied the interactive impacts of copper (Cu) and CO2 enrichment on two natural phytoplankton communities from the eastern and central Arabian Sea. Low dissolved silicate (DSi < 2 mu M) favoured smaller diatoms (e.g. Nitzschia sp.) and non-diatom (Phaeocystis). CO2 enrichment caused both positive (Nitzschia sp. and Phaeocystis sp.) and negative (Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula sp., Pseudo-nitzschia sp., Alexandrium sp., and Gymnodinium sp.) growth impacts. The addition of Cu under the ambient CO2 level (A-CO2) hindered cell division in most of the species, whereas Chla contents were nearly unaffected. Interestingly, CO2 enrichment seemed to alleviate Cu toxicity in some species (Nitzschia sp., Cylindrotheca closterium, Guinardia flaccida, and Phaeocystis) and increased their growth rates. This could be related to the cellular Cu demand and energy budget at elevated CO2 levels. Dinoflagellates were more sensitive to Cu supply compared to diatoms and prymnesiophytes and could be related to the unavailability of prey. Such community shifts in response to the projected ocean acidification, oligotrophy, and Cu pollution may impact trophic transfer and carbon cycling in this region.","2023-01","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","7325-7344","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000847298500003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;116</p>","","","Arabian Sea; CARBON ACQUISITION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONCENTRATING MECHANISMS; Copper; COPPER TOXICITY; GROWTH-RATE; MARINE DIATOM; Ocean acidification; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; Pennate diatom; Phaeocystis; PHAEODACTYLUM-TRICORNUTUM; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; Phytoplankton; THALASSIOSIRA-PSEUDONANA; Toxicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adaptive bleaching and acclimatization of corals, which posits bleaching as an opportunity for the coral host to switch its currently susceptible endosymbionts to more stress-tolerant taxa, offers hope for survival of reefs amid rapidly warming oceans. In this study, we explored the diversity and distribution of coral-zooxanthellae associations in the context of geospatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) and thermal anomalies across the Philippine archipelago. Thermal clusters based on annual sea surface temperature means and each site's frequency of exposure to heat stress were described using three-decade (1985-2018) remotely sensed data. Haphazard sampling of 628 coral fragments was conducted in 14 reef sites over 3 years (2015-2018). Using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprinting and sequencing of the zooxanthellae ITS2 region, we characterized endosymbiont diversity within four reef-building coral families across archipelagic thermal regimes. Consistency in dominant Symbiodiniaceae taxon was observed in Acropora spp., Porites spp., and Heliopora coerulea. In contrast, the family Pocilloporidae (Pocillopora spp., Seriatopora spp., and Stylophora pistillata) exhibited biogeographic variability in zooxanthellae composition, concordant with inferred occurrences of sustained thermal stress. Multivariate analyses identify two broad Pocilloporidae clusters that correspond with mean SST ranges and frequency of exposure to bleaching-level thermal stress which are largely supported by ANOSIM. Differences in zooxanthellae assemblages may reflect host-specific responses to ecological or environmental gradients across biogeographic regions. Such patterns of variability provide insight and support for the adaptability and potential resilience of coral communities in geographically and oceanographically complex regions, especially amidst the increasing severity of global and local-scale stressors.","2021-10-20","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000715955500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;140</p>","","","ALGAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; BLEACHING EVENT; CLADE-D; CLIMATE-CHANGE; coral bleaching; Coral Triangle; coral-algal symbiosis; DINOFLAGELLATES SYMBIODINIUM; GENETIC DIVERSITY; HEAT TOLERANCE; PCR-DGGE fingerprinting; REEF-BUILDING CORALS; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; Symbiodiniaceae; thermal stress; TROPICAL REEFS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most consistent trend observed at all stations was a long-term increase in surface salinity of similar to 0.003 +/- 0.0008 psu yr(-1). All stations showed positive trends in temperature, with the fastest surface warming (0.0202 degrees C yr(-1) over 60 yr) in the western Tasman Sea. Long-term trends in warming and stratification were more evident in some months and were not well characterized by annual averages. There was no general pattern of increasing stratification (0 to 50 m); only some stations and a few months showed significant changes. Long-term trends in surface nitrate and phosphate concentrations were either not significant (3 instances) or positive (5 instances) and were up to 6.1 nM phosphate yr(-1). A pronounced decline in silicate was evident at the 3 east coast stations, with concentrations falling by as much as 58 nM yr(-1) over the last similar to 30 yr. The western Tasman Sea experienced a similar to 50% decline in the growth rate and biomass of the spring bloom from 1997 to 2007, while other sites showed significant temporal variability in chlorophyll a that was associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Diatoms tended to dominate the microplankton, especially during periods of low stratification.

A sediment survey in Ria de Vigo in April 1986 indicated that the highest concentrations of cysts of this species were located in the middle sections of the ria, with maximum abundance of 310 cysts cm-3. The effects of temperature, growth medium composition and irradiance on the germination of laboratory-produced resting cysts were investigated. Newly formed cysts required very little time for maturation, as excystment was possible within 2 weeks of encystment. Growth media did not affect germination success. In contrast, the excystment rate was retarded significantly in darkness. Germination was also strongly affected by temperature, with approximately 75% excystment success at 22-28-degrees-C and little or no germination below 11-degrees-C after 1 month of incubation. In culture. the optimum growth rate of vegetative cells was between 22 and 28-degrees-C. the highest rate being 0.53 divisions day-1 at 24-degrees-C. Growth did not occur at temperatures < 11-degrees-C or >30-degrees-C. These results are important with respect to the different hypotheses proposed to explain the initiation of G.catenatum blooms in the Galician Rias Bajas and Northern Portugal. The pattern of G.catenatum bloom development along this coast has been related to seasonal upwelling in the area, with major blooms occurring during the autumn as warmer offshore surface water is transported towards the coast when upwelling relaxes. The landward transport of established offshore populations of G.catenatum with the warm surface layer remains a viable explanation for the observed blooms within the rias, but alternatively. our data suggest that cysts within the rias can provide the inoculum population at times conducive to growth and bloom formation. Even though newly formed G.catenatum cysts have a very short maturation time and can germinate in darkness across a wide temperature range, bloom development will be significant only during the late summer and early autumn, since in other months light levels at the sediment surface and temperatures throughout the water column are too low for significant germination or growth.","1994-05","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","513-525","","5","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:A1994NM09500006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;82<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;87<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;40</p>","","","BLOOMS; CERATIUM-HIRUNDINELLA; CYSTS; DINOPHYCEAE; GERMINATION; GONYAULAX-TAMARENSIS; GRAHAM; LIFE-CYCLE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; RED TIDE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed the physiological and proteomic responses of cultures of the dinoflagellate coral symbiont Symbiodinium microadriaticum to elevated temperature under low-nutrient, high-nutrient and phosphate-limited conditions. Elevated temperature induced reductions of many chloroplast proteins, particularly the light-harvesting complexes, and simultaneously increased the abundance of many chaperone proteins. Proteomes were similar when the N:P ratio was near the Redfield ratio, regardless of absolute N and P concentrations, but were strongly affected by phosphate limitation. Very high N:P inhibited Symbiodinium cell division while increasing the abundance of chloroplast proteins. The proteome response to phosphate limitation was greater than that to elevated temperature, as measured by the number of differentially abundant proteins. Increased physiological sensitivity to high temperatures under high nutrients or imbalanced N:P ratios was not apparent; however, oxidative stress response proteins were enriched among proteins responding to thermal stress under imbalanced N:P ratios.

However, how mixotrophs respond to projected ocean warming remains a debatable topic. To close the knowledge gap, we investigated the thermal responses of growth rate and functional traits of a mixotrophic dinoflagellate (Lepidodinium sp.) isolated from subtropical coastal waters. We found that Lepidodinium sp. is a facultative mixotroph with an obligate phototrophic lifestyle that adjusts its phagocytotic feeding according to inorganic nutrient concentrations. The thermal sensitivity in terms of activation energy (Ea, eV) of Lepidodinium sp. grown in mixotrophic mode (with sufficient prey, 0.69-0.89 eV) was significantly higher than in autotrophic mode (without prey, 0.30-0.37 eV). This finding is consistent with the results of predominantly heterotrophic mixotrophs, providing experimental evidence for the hypothesis that mixotrophs shift towards more heterotrophy with rising temperatures. Warming stimulated a higher growth rate of Lepidodinium sp. grown in mixotrophic conditions than in autotrophic conditions, indicating that mixotrophic dinoflagellates may benefit substantially from mixotrophy when temperature increases and prey is sufficient. Moreover, the cell size of both autotrophic and mixotrophic Lepidodinium sp. decreased with increasing temperature. The N:P and C:P ratios of Lepidodinium sp. did not vary with temperature, while the C:N ratio slightly increased. Our results suggest that mixotrophs like Lepidodinium sp. would become more heterotrophic with higher growth rates in warming oceans. The subsequent changes in their functional role from primary producers to consumers may affect food web dynamics and carbon and nutrient cycling.","2021-11-11","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","37-49","","","678","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000720333500003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;57</p>","","","FLOWCAM; GROWTH-RATES; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; Mixotrophs; NITROGEN; Nutrition; PHAGOTROPHY; PREY; PROTISTS; SIZE; Stoichiometric ratio; STOICHIOMETRY; Temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the lack of long-term instrumental data often impeded analyses attempting to associate dynamics of phytoplankton with variation of internal P loading. Here, elements and lipid biomarkers were analyzed in a sediment core from Lake Heihai, a small, deep, and ultraoligotrophic alpine lake in Haba Mountain, Yunnan Province, SW China. The data document incredible enrichment of element iron (Fe) in the sediment, whose concentrations are much higher than those of other common major elements including titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). This finding, together with the abundance correlation between P and Fe (n = 30, R (2) = 0.783) suggested that P was probably retained in sediments through sorption with micro-layer of FeOOH at the sediment-water interface. The P/Ti ratios, P/Fe ratios, and P/total organic carbon (TOC) ratios all declined in the sediment since 1980, perhaps indicating increased P release from sediments to the overlying water column initiated by hypolimnion anoxia and sulfidic, which is presumably triggered by regional climate warming since the 1980s. The P-rich bottom water can be injected into photic zone during wind-driven mixing and overturn of the water column, although its frequency and intensity might decline due to stronger water column stratification in warming climate. In response, diatoms exhibited a rapid increase of productivity at this time, because diatoms have a storage vacuole and thereby nutrients such as P can be concentrated and used for cell division long after they are depleted in the bulk fluid.

Understanding the conditions under which increased genetic variation in Symbiodiniaceae arises via sexual recombination can support efforts to evolve thermal tolerance in these symbionts and ultimately mitigate coral bleaching, the breakdown of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae partnership under stress. However, direct observations of meiosis in Symbiodiniaceae have not been reported, despite various lines of indirect evidence that it occurs. We present the first cytological evidence of sex in Symbiodiniaceae based on nuclear DNA content and morphology using Image Flow Cytometry, Cell Sorting and Confocal Microscopy. We show the Symbiodiniaceae species, Cladocopium latusorum, undergoes gamete conjugation, zygote formation, and meiosis within a dominant reef-building coral in situ. On average, sex was detected in 1.5% of the cells analyzed (N = 10,000-40,000 cells observed per sample in a total of 20 samples obtained from 3 Pocillopora colonies). We hypothesize that meiosis follows a two-step process described in other dinoflagellates, in which diploid zygotes form dyads during meiosis I, and triads and tetrads as final products of meiosis II. This study sets the stage for investigating environmental triggers of Symbiodiniaceae sexuality and can accelerate the assisted evolution of a key coral symbiont in order to combat reef degradation.","2021-09-22","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000700297100083","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;72</p>","","","ADAPTATION; CELL-DIVISION; DINOFLAGELLATE; DINOPHYCEAE; ECOLOGY; ENDOSYMBIONTS; IN-SITU; LIFE-CYCLE; MICROADRIATICUM FREUDENTHAL; REEF CORAL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All of the OHH Centers, from the east coast to Hawaii, include one or more research projects devoted to studying HAB problems and their relationship to human health. The research shares common goals for understanding, monitoring and predicting HAB events to protect and improve human health: understanding the basic biology of the organisms; identifying how chemistry, hydrography and genetic diversity influence blooms; developing analytical methods and sensors for cells and toxins; understanding health effects of toxin exposure; and developing conceptual, empirical and numerical models of bloom dynamics. Results: In the past several years, there has been significant progress toward all of the common goals. Several studies have elucidated the effects of environmental conditions and genetic heterogeneity on bloom dynamics. New methods have been developed or implemented for the detection of HAB cells and toxins, including genetic assays for Pseudo-nitzschia and Microcystis, and a biosensor for domoic acid. There have been advances in predictive models of blooms, most notably for the toxic dinoflagellates Alexandrium and Karenia. Other work is focused on the future, studying the ways in which climate change may affect HAB incidence, and assessing the threat from emerging HABs and toxins, such as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine. Conclusion: Along the way, many challenges have been encountered that are common to the OHH Centers and also echo those of the wider HAB community. Long-term field data and basic biological information are needed to develop accurate models. Sensor development is hindered by the lack of simple and rapid assays for algal cells and especially toxins. It is also critical to adequately understand the human health effects of HAB toxins. Currently, we understand best the effects of acute toxicity, but almost nothing is known about the effects of chronic, subacute toxin exposure. The OHH initiatives have brought scientists together to work collectively on HAB issues, within and across regions. The successes that have been achieved highlight the value of collaboration and cooperation across disciplines, if we are to continue to advance our understanding of HABs and their relationship to human health.","2008","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000261453800002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;54<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;72<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;112</p>","","","CELL-DIVISION; DINOFLAGELLATE KARENIA-BREVIS; DOMOIC-ACID; ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS; FLORIDA RED-TIDE; GAMBIERDISCUS-TOXICUS; GENE-CLUSTER; MICROCYSTIN BIOSYNTHESIS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PSEUDO-NITZSCHIA-MULTISERIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mutualistic relationship between tropical corals and their dinoflagellate symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) provide structural and nutritional basis for a high local biodiversity in oligotrophic waters. Here, we investigated effects of crude oil water-accommodated fraction on the competitive fitness of the model zooxanthellae species Symbiodinium glynnii. Results of laboratory essays demonstrate that crude oil carbon is incorporated into the cellular biomass with a concomitant change of delta C-13 isotopic value. Carcinogenic/mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified in the culture media and were responsible for a linear reduction in population growth of S. glynnii, presumably related to energy relocation for DNA repair. Additionally, the experiments revealed that physiological effects induced by crude oil compounds are genetically inherited by the following generations under non-contaminated growth conditions, and induce a reduction in the competitive fitness to cope with other environmental parameters, such as low salinity. We suggest that the effects of crude oil contamination represent an imparing factor for S. glynnii coping with anthropogenic drivers (e.g. warming and acidification) and interfere with the delicate symbiont-host relationship of tropical corals. This is especially relevant in the coastal areas of northeastern Brazil where an oil spill event deposited crude oil on shallow water sediments with the potential to be resuspended to the water column by physical and/or biological activity, enhancing the risk of future coral bleaching events.","2021-11-15","2025-03-05 14:40:27","2025-03-05 14:40:27","","","","","289","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000697053600010","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;105</p>","","","CARBON; Coral reef; DEEP-WATER-HORIZON; FREE-LIVING SYMBIODINIUM; GENETIC DIVERSITY; Northeast Brazil; Oil spill; PAHS; PHENANTHRENE; PHYTOPLANKTON; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; RESPONSES; SEAWATER; Stable carbon isotope fractionation (delta C-13); Symbiodiniaceae; Zooxanthellae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adaptations may occur in temperature-dependent traits, such as growth rate, cell size and life cycle processes. Using resurrection experiments with resting stages from living sediment archives, it is possible to investigate whether adaptation occurred. For this study, we revived resting cysts of the spring bloom dinoflagellate Apocalathium malmogiense from recent and 100-year-old sediment layers from the Gulf of Finland, and compared temperature-dependent traits of recent and historic strains along a temperature gradient. We detected no changes in growth rates and cell sizes but a significant difference between recent and historic strains regarding resting cyst formation. The encystment rate of recent strains was significantly lower compared with historic strains which we interpret as an indication of adaptation to higher and more rapidly increasing spring temperatures. Low encystment rates may allow for bloom formation even if the threshold temperature inducing a loss of actively growing cells through resting cyst formation is exceeded. Our findings reveal that phenotypic responses of phytoplankton to changing temperature conditions may include hidden traits such as life cycle processes and their regulation mechanisms.

The coral symbiosis is highly susceptible to elevated temperatures, resulting in coral bleaching, where the algal symbiont is released from host cells. This experiment aimed to determine the transcriptional changes in cultured Symbiodinium, to better understand the response of cellular mechanisms under future temperature conditions. Cultures were exposed to elevated temperatures (average 31 degrees C) or control conditions (24.5 degrees C) for a period of 28 days. Whole transcriptome sequencing of Symbiodinium cells on days 4, 19, and 28 were used to identify differentially expressed genes under thermal stress. A large number of genes representing 37.01% of the transcriptome (similar to 23,654 unique genes, FDR < 0.05) with differential expression were detected at no less than one of the time points. Consistent with previous studies of Symbiodinium gene expression, fold changes across the transcriptome were low, with 92.49% differentially expressed genes at <= 2-fold change. The transcriptional response included differential expression of genes encoding stress response components such as the antioxidant network and molecular chaperones, cellular components such as core photosynthesis machinery, integral light-harvesting protein complexes and enzymes such as fatty acid desaturases. Differential expression of genes encoding glyoxylate cycle enzymes were also found, representing the first report of this in Symbiodinium. As photosynthate transfer from Symbiodinium to coral hosts provides up to 90% of a coral's daily energy requirements, the implications of altered metabolic processes from exposure to thermal stress found in this study on coral-Symbiodinium associations are unknown and should be considered when assessing the stability of the symbiotic relationship under future climate conditions.","2017-02-28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000394893200002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;78<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;83<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;110</p>","","","ACROPORA-DIGITIFERA; CELL-DIVISION; CHLOROPHYLL-PROTEIN COMPLEXES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DE-NOVO SYNTHESIS; dinoflagellates; DINOPHYCEAE; gene expression; GENOME; HEAT-STRESS; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; RNA-Seq; RNA-SEQ DATA; Symbiodinium; thermal stress; transcriptome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The transfer of P. cordatum and G. fissum cells, which have a maximum intracellular pool of nutrients, to seawater depleted in nutrients decreases their specific growth rate and chlorophyll a content per cell. Due to the intracellular pool of nutrients, P. cordatum performs 3.3 cell divisions in 9 days and G. fissum performs 2.3 cell divisions in 4 days. After the exhaustion of the intracellular reserves of nutrients in the culture of G. fissum for 16 days, the growth of its cells ceases and the specific content of chlorophyll a, as well as the efficiency of the photosystem 2, decreases. In the P. micans culture, which is under the conditions of the most severe biogenic limitation throughout the 20-day experiment, against the background of an almost constant number of cells, an alternation of low positive and negative values of the specific growth rate is observed, as well as a low content of chlorophyll a per cell. However, the efficiency of photosystem 2 remains at a sufficiently high level (0.27-0.41) and exceeds the control values most of the time. This study reveals a high degree of heterogeneity of the functional activity of this species cells and the death of some of them under biogenic stress. The survival of P. micans under biogenic stress is probably ensured by the nutrients that enter the water during the death of the least viable part of its cells and serves as a source of organic matters for the physiologically active cells of microalgae.","2021-03","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","222-230","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000644646100012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;29</p>","","","biogenic limitation; Black Sea; CLIMATE; DIATOMS; dinoflagellates; GROWTH; phytoplankton; REGIME; SEA; STRESS; VARIABILITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under climate warming, temperature anomalies and associated coral bleaching events will increase in frequency and severity. Therefore, it is imperative to better understand the variability in key phenotypic traits of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae association under such high temperature stress.

We characterised algal growth and thylakoid membrane stability under different thermal scenarios and demonstrate previously undocumented physiological diversity among strains of a single Symbiodiniaceae species.

The nature of the relationship is such that these symbiotic algae provide products of photosynthesis to their cnidarian hosts, while the algae are afforded refuge within the endodermal cells of the host. Use of the model system Cassiopea xamachana (a.k.a. the 'upside down jellyfish'), a scyphozoan that can be reared throughout its entire life cycle in a laboratory setting, allowed for the study of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis without many of the constraints involved when working with corals and other cnidarians. The aposymbiotic polyp stage of C. xamachana was used in this study to visualize the acquisition of algal cells by endodermal cells of host animals, a requisite phenomenon for the transition to a free living medusae (strobilation). Polyps harboring algae from environmental sources prior to experimentation were subjected to high temperatures to initiate the expulsion of algae and to obtain polyps that were completely free of symbionts (aposymbiotic); bleaching was confirmed with high resolution confocal microscopy. Aposymbiotic polyps were subsequently introduced to low numbers of Symbiodinium, and the intrinsic growth rate of algae calculated based on count data generated at 7-day intervals. Symbiodinium used for reintroduction in experimental trials were obtained from three sources: (1) commercially cultured algal cells (type A194), (2) algae that had been expelled from their host tissues following heat-induced bleaching in the laboratory, and (3) algae freshly isolated from an adult medusa. These three sources of algal cells were used to represent the possible reservoirs from which bleached animals might replenish their symbiont population following a bleaching event. Symbiodinium cells were acquired by C. xamachana polyps in all three treatment groups, although cultured Symbiodinium A194 exhibited the slowest mean intrinsic growth rate (0.054 d(-1)) once they were housed within endodermal cells of their host. Mean time to strobilation was accordingly slow (> 120 days) for those polyps harboring type A194 symbionts. In fact, polyps harboring other sourced Symbiodinium strobilated in < 70 days on average. Though it is known that strobilation does not occur without the acquisition of symbionts during the polyp stage, the results provided in this study demonstrate clearly that the number of symbionts at the time of strobilation can vary greatly. This variation in symbiont number just prior to strobilation, substantiates previous documented evidence that strobilation is not only stimulated by acquisition of Symbiodinium, but by other triggers as well. Our methods allow quantitative methods to be used to discover additional components involved in the establishment of successful symbiosis between these species.","2018-11","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","44-51","","","508","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000446287900006","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;37</p>","","","CELL-DIVISION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DINOFLAGELLATE SYMBIODINIUM-MICROADRIATICUM; ENDOSYMBIOTIC ALGAE; Intrinsic growth rate; METAMORPHOSIS; REEF CORALS; SEA; Strobilation; STROBILATION; Symbiodinium microadriaticum; Symbiosis; TEMPERATURE; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined how microbial eukaryotes with differing thermal histories responded to temperature fluctuations of different amplitudes (0 control, +/- 2, +/- 4 degrees C) around mean temperatures below or above their T-opt. Cosmopolitan dinoflagellates were selected based on their distinct thermal traits and included two species of the same genus (tropical and temperate Coolia spp.), and two strains of the same species maintained at different temperatures for >500 generations (tropical Amphidinium massartii control temperature and high temperature, CT and HT, respectively). There was a universal decline in population growth rate under temperature fluctuations, but strains with narrower thermal niche breadth (temperate Coolia and HT) showed similar to 10% greater reduction in growth. At suboptimal mean temperatures, cells in the cool phase of the fluctuation stopped dividing, fixed less carbon (C) and had enlarged cell volumes that scaled positively with elemental C, N, and P and C:Chlorophyll-a. However, at a supra-optimal mean temperature, fixed C was directed away from cell division and novel trait combinations developed, leading to greater phenotypic diversity. At the molecular level, heat-shock proteins, and chaperones, in addition to transcripts involving genome rearrangements, were upregulated in CT and HT during the warm phase of the supra-optimal fluctuation (30 +/- 4 degrees C), a stress response indicating protection. In contrast, the tropical Coolia species upregulated major energy pathways in the warm phase of its supra-optimal fluctuation (25 +/- 4 degrees C), indicating a broadscale shift in metabolism. Our results demonstrate divergent effects between taxa and that temporal variability in environmental conditions interacts with changes in the thermal mean to mediate microbial responses to global change, with implications for biogeochemical cycling.","2022-10","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","5741-5754","","19","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000827888600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;77</p>","","","ADAPTATION; ANNOTATION; climate impact; climate variability; dinoflagellate; ECOLOGY; ENVIRONMENT; EVOLUTIONARY; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; IMPACT; PHYTOPLANKTON; primary productivity; RESPONSES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, no similar relationship exists for the major phytoplankton predators, the herbivorous protists, especially at low temperatures representing polar and coastal oceans during most seasons. Their acclimation to changing temperatures is also largely unexplored. Here we report acclimated growth and acclimation rates from 0 to 22 degrees C for 3 cosmopolitan herbivorous dinoflagellates. Due to interactive effects between size and temperature, growth increased 40% more rapidly with increasing temperature for production- compared to division-based growth rates (0.043 and 0.062 d(-1) degrees C-1, respectively). Biomass-based growth rates were 10-fold higher than abundance-based rates at low temperatures, reflecting an average 50% increase in biovolume at <= 2 degrees C. Thus, there was significant biomass accumulation at low temperatures, despite low cell-division rates. Testing different acclimation procedures, we established that acclimated rates emerged after 3 generations. Herbivores required 1.25 d degrees C-1 when acclimating towards higher temperatures and 2.5 d degrees C-1 when transitioning towards lower temperatures. Growth rates increased linearly with temperature, implying a weaker temperature effect on growth than the commonly assumed exponential dependency. A possible consequence is that herbivore growth rates are underestimated at cold and overestimated at warm temperatures. Current and future ocean assessments could thus underestimate trophic transfer rates in polar and cold-water regions and overestimate herbivore growth and thus grazing impact in future ocean predictions. Identifying physiological responses that transcend species-specificity supports cross-biome comparisons of ecosystem structure and function that rely on accurate predictions of matter and energy flow in planktonic food webs.

They are important primary producers and carbon sinks but their physiology and persistence are severely affected by global climate change. Powerful experimental evolution technologies are being used to examine the potential of microalgae to respond adaptively to current and predicted future conditions, as well as to develop resources to facilitate species conservation and restoration of ecosystem functions. This review synthesizes findings and insights from experimental evolution studies of marine microalgae in response to elevated temperature and/or pCO(2). Adaptation to these environmental conditions has been observed in many studies of marine dinoflagellates, diatoms and coccolithophores. An enhancement in traits such as growth and photo-physiological performance and an increase in upper thermal limit have been shown to be possible, although the extent and rate of change differ between microalgal taxa. Studies employing multiple monoclonal replicates showed variation in responses among replicates and revealed the stochasticity of mutations. The work to date is already providing valuable information on species' climate sensitivity or resilience to managers and policymakers but extrapolating these insights to ecosystem- and community-level impacts continues to be a challenge. We recommend future work should include in situ experiments, diurnal and seasonal fluctuations, multiple drivers and multiple starting genotypes. Fitness trade-offs, stable versus plastic responses and the genetic bases of the changes also need investigating, and the incorporation of genome resequencing into experimental designs will be invaluable.","2021-05","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","1737-1754","","9","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000619846100001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;118</p>","","","adaptation; ADAPTATION; CELL-CYCLE; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; experimental evolution; EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION; FLUCTUATING SELECTION; global climate change; laboratory domestication; LIFE-HISTORY; marine microalgae; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; SEAWATER CARBONATE CHEMISTRY; Symbiodiniaceae; SYMBIODINIUM-MICROADRIATICUM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The breakdown of this mutualism that occurs as a result of increasingly warmer ocean temperatures is a major threat to coral reef ecosystems globally. Recombination during sexual reproduction and high rates of somatic mutation can lead to increased genetic variation within symbiont species, which may provide the fuel for natural selection and adaptation. However, few studies have asked whether such variation in functional traits exists within these symbionts. We used several genotypes of two closely related species, Breviolum antillogorgium and B. minutum, to examine variation of traits related to symbiosis in response to increases in temperature or nitrogen availability in laboratory cultures. We found significant genetic variation within and among symbiont species in chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, and growth rate. Two genotypes showed decreases in traits in response to increased temperatures predicted by climate change, but one genotype responded positively. Similarly, some genotypes within a species responded positively to high-nitrogen environments, such as those expected within hosts or eutrophication associated with global change, while other genotypes in the same species responded negatively, suggesting context-dependency in the strength of mutualism. Such variation in traits implies that there is potential for natural selection on symbionts in response to temperature and nutrients, which could confer an adaptive advantage to the holobiont.","2019-03","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","2803-2813","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000460668800037","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;26<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;107</p>","","","ALGAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; BLEACHING EVENT; climate change; DINOFLAGELLATES SYMBIODINIUM; DIVERSITY; evolutionary rescue; genetic variation; MARINE COELENTERATES; mutualism; natural selection; PHOTOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTS; SEA FAN; SP-NOV DINOPHYCEAE; THERMAL TOLERANCE; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prokaryotic symbionts of corals are important for host fitness but are also highly sensitive to changes in the environment. In this study, we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing to examine the response of the microbial community associated with the coral, Acropora digitifera, to elevated temperature. The A. digitifera microbial community is dominated by operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) affiliated with classes Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. The prokaryotic community in the coral tissue is distinct from that of the mucus and the surrounding seawater. Remarkably, the overall microbial community structure of A. digitifera remained stable for 10 days of continuous exptosure at 32 degrees C compared to corals maintained at 27 degrees C. However, the elevated temperature regime resulted in a decrease in the abundance of OTUs affiliated with certain groups of bacteria, such as order Rhodobacterales. On the other hand, some OTUs affiliated with the orders Alteromonadales, Vibrionales, and Flavobacteriales, which are often associated with diseased and stressed corals, increased in abundance. Thus, while the A. digitifera bacterial community structure appears resilient to higher temperature, prolonged exposure and intensified stress results in changes in the abundance of specific microbial community members that may affect the overall metabolic state and health of the coral holobiont.","2017-08","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000407573700030","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;35<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;37<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;102</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; coral; CORAL-ASSOCIATED BACTERIA; DIVERSITY; holobiont; HOLOBIONTS; microbiome; mucus; MUCUS-ASSOCIATED BACTERIA; REEF; SEQUENCE; SP-NOV.; thermal stress; THERMAL-STRESS; VIBRIO-CORALLIILYTICUS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, P. glacialis-like genotypes were found in temperate waters. Here, we investigated how P. glacialis would respond if it were transported from polar to temperate waters by shifting cultures of P. glacialis (strain CCMP2088) from 4 degrees C to 10 degrees and 15 degrees C. After a 4-day lag phase, the cultures remaining at 4 degrees C grew exponentially at 0.10 +/- 0.17 d(-1) for 22 days before entering early stationary phase. Consistent to this growth pattern, flow cytometric analysis on samples collected at the same time showed higher percentages of S-cells on day 9 and day 12 than day 33 and day 37. Western blot analysis of the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco(1) (typically 55 kDa) and the cell cycle-related protein PCNA(2) (typically 36 kDa) revealed active expression of both proteins, and higher expression in exponential growth than in early stationary phase. In comparison, cultures shifted to 10 degrees and 15 degrees C first experienced a 4-day lag phase plus a 13-15 day declining phase (growth rates were -0.21 +/- 0.10 d(-1) and -0.23 +/- 0.08 d(-1) respectively), then a steady cell density period (growth rates were 0.05 +/- 0.12 d(-1) and 0.01 +/- 0.15 d(-1) respectively). Strikingly, the percentages of the G(2)/M phase (%G(2)M) in the 10 degrees C-cultures remained at high levels and G(1) population at a low level, suggesting that a subpopulation of the cells might still be actively dividing. %G(2)M of the 15 degrees C-culture remained to be the lowest among the three temperature treatments (P<0.05), indicative of least active cell division. Molecular apparatus of photosynthesis and cell division cycle appeared to be substantially damaged as the culture stayed longer at the elevated temperatures, as evidenced by the progressive degradation of Rubisco and aggregation of PCNA. Our results show that although extreme heat shock as exerted by the temperature rise from 4 degrees C to 10 degrees or 15 degrees C caused impairment of molecular engines of photosynthesis and cell division cycle and extensive population decline in P. glacialis, this polar dinoflagellate seems to be able to survive the extreme temperature insults and potentially can be spread by humans to temperate regions.

The IFR-VRU-01 strain, isolated from a French Mediterranean lagoon in 2010 and identified as the causative dinoflagellate contaminating mussels in the Ingril Lagoon (French Mediterranean) with pinnatoxin-G, was grown in an enriched natural seawater medium. We tested the effect of temperature and salinity on growth, pinnatoxin-G production and chlorophyll a levels of this dinoflagellate. These factors were tested in combinations of five temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C) and five salinities (20, 25, 30, 35 and 40) at an irradiance of 100 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). V. rugosum can grow at temperatures and salinities ranging from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C and 20 to 40, respectively. The optimal combination for growth (0.39 +/- 0.11 d(-1)) was a temperature of 25 degrees C and a salinity of 40. Results suggest that V. rugosum is euryhaline and thermophile which could explain why this dinoflagellate develops in situ only from June to September. V. rugosum growth rate and pinnatoxin-G production were highest at temperatures ranging between 25 and 30 degrees C. This suggests that the dinoflagellate may give rise to extensive blooms in the coming decades caused by the climate change-related increases in temperature expected in the Mediterranean coasts.","2016-05","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000377428300017","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;18<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;76</p>","","","ALEXANDRIUM-TAMARENSE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; growth conditions; GYMNODINIUM-CATENATUM DINOPHYCEAE; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; HIROSHIMA BAY; MARINE DINOFLAGELLATE; Mediterranean Ingril Lagoon; PARALYTIC SHELLFISH; PINNATOXINS E; RESTING CYSTS; salinity; temperature; toxin production; Vulcanodinium rugosum","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fundamental question in coral reef ecology is whether chronic local stress reduces coral resistance and resilience from episodic stress such as bleaching, or alternatively promotes acclimatization, potentially increasing resistance and resilience. Here we show that following a major bleaching event, Montastraea faveolata coral growth rates at sites with higher local anthropogenic stressors remained suppressed for at least 8 years, while coral growth rates at sites with lower stress recovered in 2-3 years. Instead of promoting acclimatization, our data indicate that background stress reduces coral fitness and resilience to episodic events. We also suggest that reducing chronic stress through local coral reef management efforts may increase coral resilience to global climate change.","2009-07-22","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","7","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000268260100007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;224<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;256<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;28</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed community structure changes in a natural mixed dinoflagellate bloom incubated at three pCO(2) levels (230, 433, and 765 ppm) in a short-term experiment (2 weeks). The four dominant species were then isolated from each treatment into clonal cultures, and maintained at all three pCO(2) levels for approximately 1 year. Periodically (4, 8, and 12 months), these pCO(2)-conditioned clones were recombined into artificial communities, and allowed to compete at their conditioning pCO(2) level or at higher and lower levels. The dominant species in these artificial communities of CO2-conditioned clones differed from those in the original short-term experiment, but individual species relative abundance trends across pCO(2) treatments were often similar. Specific growth rates showed no strong evidence for fitness increases attributable to conditioning pCO(2) level. Although pCO(2) significantly structured our experimental communities, conditioning time and biotic interactions like mixotrophy also had major roles in determining competitive outcomes.

We conducted laboratory experiments with an artificial phytoplankton community to mimic a rapid temperature increase (from 21 degrees C to 29 degrees C) at low nutrient levels ('heat wave scenario'), respectively temperature decrease (from 21 degrees C to 16 degrees C) and increased nutrient load ('heavy rainfall scenario'). We hypothesised that there is a taxon specific nutrient x temperature interaction, leading to significant shifts in the phytoplankton community composition when both variables change. To separate the temperature effect from the nutrient effect, we performed another experimental series at a reduced temperature but without addition of nutrients. As expected, the nutrient effect was overall more important than temperature and significantly affected all five taxa tested that represented different algal classes. However, temperature also played an important role for community composition, because the cryptophyte Cryptomonas sp. and the dinoflagellate Peridinium sp. reached significantly higher biovolumes at lower temperatures. The nutrient x temperature interaction was significant in the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus. These findings suggest that our experimental results cannot be interpreted primarily by species competition for nutrients. Heterotrophic bacteria were present in all experiments. Bacterial biomass was significantly positively related to temperature and nutrients. However, relative to phytoplankton biovolume, bacterial biovolume decreased under nutrient replete conditions. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that short-term environmental change may significantly affect both the phytoplankton community (in terms of species dominance and total biomass) and the ratio between autotrophs and heterotrophs in temperate lakes.

As symbiont-derived organic products typically form a major portion of host energy budgets, this has major implications for the fitness and persistence of symbiotic corals. Objectives We aimed to determine change in autotrophic carbon fate within individual compounds and downstream metabolic pathways in a coral symbiosis exposed to varying degrees of thermal stress and bleaching. Methods We applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled to a stable isotope tracer (C-13), to track change in autotrophic carbon fate, in symbiont and host individually, following exposure to elevated water temperature. Results Thermal stress resulted in partner-specific changes in carbon fate, which progressed with heat stress duration. We detected modifications to carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism, lipogenesis, and homeostatic responses to thermal, oxidative and osmotic stress. Despite pronounced photodamage, remaining in hospite symbionts continued to produce organic products de novo and translocate to the coral host. However as bleaching progressed, we observed minimal C-13 enrichment of symbiont long-chain fatty acids, also reflected in C-13 enrichment of host fatty acid pools. Conclusion These data have major implications for our understanding of coral symbiosis function during bleaching. Our findings suggest that during early stage bleaching, remaining symbionts continue to effectively translocate a variety of organic products to the host, however under prolonged thermal stress there is likely a reduction in the quality of these products.","2018-01","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000424713300012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;50<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;59<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;50</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; Cnidarian; CNIDARIAN SYMBIOSIS; DIGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL COMPOSITION; DINOFLAGELLATE SYMBIOSIS; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; GC-MS; Metabolite; MODEL; Photoinhibition; REEF CORALS; Stable isotope tracer; STRESS; Symbiodinium; SYMBIOTIC ALGAE; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coral thermal tolerance is partly dependent on the Symbiodinium hosted. Therefore, directed laboratory evolution in Symbiodinium has been proposed as a strategy to enhance coral holobiont thermal tolerance. Using a reciprocal transplant design, we show that the upper temperature tolerance and temperature tolerance range of Symbiodinium C1 increased after similar to 80 asexual generations (2.5 years) of laboratory thermal selection. Relative to wild-type cells, selected cells showed superior photophysiological performance and growth rate at 31 degrees C invitro, and performed no worse at 27 degrees C; they also had lower levels of extracellular reactive oxygen species (exROS). In contrast, wild-type cells were unable to photosynthesise or grow at 31 degrees C and produced up to 17 times more exROS. In symbiosis, the increased thermal tolerance acquired ex hospite was less apparent. In recruits of two of three species tested, those harbouring selected cells showed no difference in growth between the 27 and 31 degrees C treatments, and a trend of positive growth at both temperatures. Recruits that were inoculated with wild-type cells, however, showed a significant difference in growth rates between the 27 and 31 degrees C treatments, with a negative growth trend at 31 degrees C. There were no significant differences in the rate and severity of bleaching in coral recruits harbouring wild-type or selected cells. Our findings highlight the need for additional Symbiodinium genotypes to be tested with this assisted evolution approach. Deciphering the genetic basis of enhanced thermal tolerance in Symbiodinium and the cause behind its limited transference to the coral holobiont in this genotype of Symbiodinium C1 are important next steps for developing methods that aim to increase coral bleaching tolerance.","2017-11","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","4675-4688","","11","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000412322700020","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;116<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;121<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;94</p>","","","Acropora cytherea; Acropora hyacinthus; Acropora sarmentosa; assisted evolution; CLIMATE-CHANGE; coral bleaching; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES; experimental evolution; FREE-LIVING SYMBIODINIUM; Great Barrier Reef; LIGHT LEVELS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; Symbiodinium; SYMBIOTIC ALGAE; thermal stress; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is supported by recent reciprocal transplant experiments with reef corals, which have shown that their microbiome adapts to thermally variable habitats and changes over time when transplanted into different environments. Further, inoculation of corals with beneficial bacteria increases their stress tolerance. But corals differ in their ability to flexibly associate with different bacteria. How scales of microbiome flexibility may reflect different metaorganism adaptation mechanisms is discussed and future directions for research are pinpointed.

To make robust projections of future global marine primary production, it is crucial to understand multiple driver effects on phytoplankton. This meta-analysis quantifies individual and interactive effects of dual driver combinations on marine phytoplankton growth rates. Almost 50% of the single-species laboratory studies were excluded because central data and metadata (growth rates, carbonate system, experimental treatments) were insufficiently reported. The remaining data (42 studies) allowed for the analysis of interactions ofpCO(2)with temperature, light, and nutrients, respectively. Growth rates mostly respond non-additively, whereby the interaction with increasedpCO(2)profusely dampens growth-enhancing effects of high temperature and high light. Multiple and single driver effects on coccolithophores differ from other phytoplankton groups, especially in their high sensitivity to increasingpCO(2). Polar species decrease their growth rate in response to highpCO(2), while temperate and tropical species benefit under these conditions. Based on the observed interactions and projected changes, we anticipate primary productivity to: (a) first increase but eventually decrease in the Arctic Ocean once nutrient limitation outweighs the benefits of higher light availability; (b) decrease in the tropics and mid-latitudes due to intensifying nutrient limitation, possibly amplified by elevatedpCO(2); and (c) increase in the Southern Ocean in view of higher nutrient availability and synergistic interaction with increasingpCO(2). Growth-enhancing effect of high light and warming to coccolithophores, mainlyEmiliania huxleyi, might increase their relative abundance as long as not offset by acidification. Dinoflagellates are expected to increase their relative abundance due to their positive growth response to increasingpCO(2)and light levels. Our analysis reveals gaps in the knowledge on multiple driver responses and provides recommendations for future work on phytoplankton.","2020-12","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","6787-6804","","12","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000579412800001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;42<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;43<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;151</p>","","","21ST-CENTURY PROJECTIONS; additivity; antagonism; CARBONATE CHEMISTRY; ELEVATED CO2; EMILIANIA-HUXLEYI; environmental drivers; growth rate; INCREASED PCO(2); interaction effect size; MICROMONAS-PUSILLA BENEFITS; NITROGEN LIMITATION; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; phytoplankton groups; primary production; SOLAR-RADIATION; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; synergism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these signals are potentially vulnerable to changes in pH and it is not yet known how predator recognition may be affected by ocean acidification. We exposed four species of diatoms and one toxic dinoflagellate to future pCO(2) levels, projected by the turn of the century, in factorial combinations with predatory cues from copepods (copepodamides). We measured the change in growth, chain length, silica content, and toxin content. Effects of increased pCO(2) were highly species specific. The induction of defensive traits was accompanied by a significant reduction in growth rate in three out of five species. The reduction averaged 39% and we interpret this as an allocation cost associated with defensive traits. Copepodamides induced significant chain length reduction in three of the four diatom species. Under elevated pCO(2) Skeletonema marinoi reduced silica content by 30% and in Alexandrium minutum the toxin content was reduced by 30%. Using copepodamides to induce defensive traits in the absence of direct grazing provides a straightforward methodology to assess costs of defense in microplankton. We conclude that copepodamide signalling system is likely robust to ocean acidification. Moreover, the variable responses of different taxa to ocean acidification suggest that there will be winners and losers in a high pCO(2) world, and that ocean acidification may have structuring effects on phytoplankton communities.","2022-04-07","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000791352900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;83</p>","","","ALEXANDRIUM-CATENELLA; CARBON-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION; chemical defenses; chemical ecology; CO2 CONCENTRATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; inducible defense; MARINE PLANKTON; ocean acidification; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; pCO(2); plankton ecology; PREDATOR LIPIDS; predator-prey interactions; SHELLFISH TOXIN PRODUCTION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adaptation in capacity to harvest and utilize light, and ""safely"" process photosynthetically generated energy is a key factor regulating their broad ecological success. However, whether such adaptive capacity similarly extends to how Symbiodiniaceae species and genotypes assimilate inorganic carbon (Ci) remains unexplored. We build on recent approaches exploring functional diversity of fitness traits to identify whether Ci uptake and incorporation could be reconciled with evolutionary adaptation among Symbiodiniaceae. We examined phylogenetically diverse Symbiodiniaceae cultures (23 isolates, 6 genera) to track how carbon was invested into cellular uptake, excretion, and growth (cell size, division, storage). Gross carbon uptake rates (GPC) over 1 h varied among isolates grown at 26 degrees C (0.63-3.08 pg C [cell h](-1)) with no evident pattern with algal phylogeny. Intriguingly, net carbon uptake rates (24 h) were often higher (1.01-5.54 pg C [cell h](-1)) than corresponding values of GPC-we discuss how such GPC measurements may reflect highly conserved biological characteristics for cultured cells linked to high metabolic dependency on photorespiration and heterotrophy. Three isolates from different genera (Cladocopium goreaui, Durusdinium trenchii, and Effrenium voratum) were additionally grown at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Here, Ci uptake consistently decreased with temperature-driven declines in growth rate, suggesting environmental regulation outweighs phylogenetic organization of carbon assimilation capacity among Symbiodiniaceae. Together, these data demonstrate environmental regulation and ecological success among Symbiodiniaceae likely rests on plasticity of upstream photosynthetic processes (light harvesting, energy quenching, etc.) to overcome evolutionary-conserved limitations in Ci functioning.","2020-08","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","1747-1763","","8","65","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000514487600001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;21<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;22<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;86</p>","","","CELL-SIZE; DIATOM; FIXATION; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHYTOPLANKTON; SHORT-TERM; SYMBIOTIC DINOFLAGELLATE SYMBIODINIUM; TEMPERATURE; THERMAL-STRESS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the thermal tolerance of coral-algal associations within seven common species of reef-building corals hosting distinct Symbiodinium sub-clades collected from Heron Island during experimentally induced bleaching conditions. During experimental heating, photosynthetic fitness was assessed by the dark-adapted yield of PSII (F (v)/F (m)), and excitation pressure across PSII (Q (m)) of each coral-algal association using pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry. The onset of bleaching was determined by the measurement of Symbiodinium cell density. Using the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) region, we showed that Symbiodinium type-coral host associations were temporally and spatially conserved in a high proportion of the colonies sampled within each species. Generally, the species Acropora millepora, Platygyra daedalea, Acropora aspera and Acropora formosa contained Symbiodinium ITS-2 type C3, whereas the species Montipora digitata, Porites cylindrica and Porites lutea contained Symbiodinium type C15. Bleaching susceptibility showed some association with Symbiodinium type, but further research is required to confirm this. Corals hosting C3 Symbiodinium displayed higher reductions in F (v)/F (m) during heating compared to their C15 counterparts, irrespective of host species. However, a corresponding reduction in Symbiodinium density was not observed. Nonetheless, A. aspera and A. formosa showed significant reductions in Symbiodinium density relative to controls. This correlated with large increases in Q (m) and decreases in F (v)/F (m) in heated explants. Our results suggest a range of bleaching susceptibilities for the coral species investigated, with A. aspera and A. formosa showing the greatest susceptibility to bleaching and M. digitata showing the lowest bleaching susceptibility. The data provide strong evidence for distinct differences in temperature tolerance between C3 and C15 Symbiodinium types when in-hospite; however, future studies addressing the confounding effect of host species would help to confirm this.","2012-06","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","473-485","","2","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000303450100019","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;85<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;96<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>","","","ALGAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; Coral bleaching; DINOFLAGELLATE SYMBIOSES; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; FREE-LIVING SYMBIODINIUM; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; Light pressure; MONTIPORA-MONASTERIATA; PHOTOCHEMICAL ACTIVITY; Photosynthesis; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; Symbiodinium; Thermal stress; THERMAL-STRESS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In April 2021, an infrastructure failure at the retired Piney Point phosphorus mining retention reservoir garnered national attention, as 814 million liters of nutrient rich water were released into Tampa Bay, Florida over 10 days. The release of nitrogen and phosphorus-rich water into Tampa Bay - a region that had been known as a restoration success story since the 1990s - has highlighted the potential for unexpected challenges for coastal nutrient management. MethodsFor a year after the release, we sampled bi-weekly at four sites to monitor changes in nutrients, stable isotopes, and phytoplankton communities, complemented with continuous monitoring by multiparameter sondes. Our data complement the synthesis efforts of regional partners, the Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay Estuary Programs, to better understand the effects of anthropogenic nutrients on estuarine health. ResultsPhytoplankton community structure indicated an initial diatom bloom that dissipated by the end of April 2021. In the summer, the bay was dominated by Karenia brevis, with conditions improving into the fall. To determine if there was a unique carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) signature of the discharge water, stable isotope values of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were analyzed in suspended particulate material (SPM). The delta N-15 values of the discharge SPM were -17.88 parts per thousand +/- 0.76, which is exceptionally low and was unique relative to other nutrient sources in the region. In May and early June of 2021, all sites exhibited a decline in the delta N-15 values of SPM, suggesting that discharged N was incorporated into SPM after the event. The occurrence of very low delta N-15 values at the reference site, on the Gulf Coast outside of the Bay, indicates that some of the discharge was transported outside of Tampa Bay. DiscussionThis work illustrates the need for comprehensive nutrient management strategies to assess and manage the full range of consequences associated with anthropogenic nutrient inputs into coastal ecosystems. Ongoing and anticipated impacts of climate change - such as increasing tropical storm intensity, temperatures, rainfall, and sea level rise - will exacerbate this need.","2023-05-24","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001006709000001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;107</p>","","","carbon; CELL-VOLUME; CERATAULINA-PELAGICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS; FLORIDA RED TIDE; GROWTH-RATE; harmful algal bloom; nitrogen; NITROGEN-CONTENT; phosphogypsum; phytoplankton; PHYTOPLANKTON; Piney Point; stable isotopes; SUBTROPICAL ESTUARY; WATER-QUALITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we explored the sensitivity of phytoplankton community structure to thermal response parameterization in a modelled marine phytoplankton community. Using published empirical data, we evaluated the maximum thermal growth rates (mu(max)) and temperature coefficients (Q(10); the rate at which growth scales with temperature) of six key Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs): coccolithophores, cyanobacteria, diatoms, diazotrophs, dinoflagellates, and green algae. Following three well-documented methods, PFTs were either assumed to have (1) the same mu(max) and the same Q(10) (as in to Eppley, 1972), (2) a unique mu(max) but the same Q(10) (similar to Kremer et al., 2017), or (3) a unique mu(max) and a unique Q(10) (following Anderson et al., 2021). These trait values were then implemented within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology biogeochemistry and ecosystem model (called Darwin) for each PFT under a control and climate change scenario. Our results suggest that applying a mu(max) and Q(10) universally across PFTs (as in Eppley, 1972) leads to unrealistic phytoplankton communities, which lack diatoms globally. Additionally, we find that accounting for differences in the Q(10) between PFTs can significantly impact each PFT's competitive ability, especially at high latitudes, leading to altered modeled phytoplankton community structures in our control and climate change simulations. This then impacts estimates of biogeochemical processes, with, for example, estimates of export production varying by similar to 10% in the Southern Ocean depending on the parameterization. Our results indicate that the diversity of thermal response traits in phytoplankton not only shape community composition in the historical and future, warmer ocean, but that these traits have significant feedbacks on global biogeochemical cycles.","2024-01","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001129149400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;71</p>","","","ACIDIFICATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DYNAMICS; EPPLEY CURVE; export processes; global change; GLOBAL OCEAN; GROWTH-RATES; marine biogeochemistry; marine ecology; model parameterization; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; phytoplankton; SIZE DEPENDENCE; TEMPERATURE; thermal traits","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With coral reefs currently under extreme threat from climate change, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding on the stress tolerance and stress avoidance mechanisms of Symbiodinium spp. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen are central players in mediating various stress responses; however, the detection of ROS using specific dyes is still far from definitive in intact Symbiodinium cells due to the hindrance of uptake of certain fluorescent dyes because of the presence of the cell wall. Protoplast technology provides a promising platform for studying oxidative stress with the main advantage of removed cell wall, however the preparation of viable protoplasts remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have successfully applied cellulose-based protoplast preparation in Symbiodiniaceae; however, the protoplast formation and regeneration process was found to be suboptimal. Here, we present a microfluidics-based platform which allowed protoplast isolation from individually trapped Symbiodinium cells, by using a precisely adjusted flow of cell wall digestion enzymes (cellulase and macerozyme). Trapped single cells exhibited characteristic changes in their morphology, cessation of cell division and a slight decrease in photosynthetic activity during protoplast formation. Following digestion and transfer to regeneration medium, protoplasts remained photosynthetically active, regrew cell walls, regained motility, and entered exponential growth. Elevated flow rates in the microfluidic chambers resulted in somewhat faster protoplast formation; however, cell wall digestion at higher flow rates partially compromised photosynthetic activity. Physiologically competent protoplasts prepared from trapped cells in microfluidic chambers allowed for the first time the visualization of the intracellular localization of singlet oxygen (using Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green dye) in Symbiodiniaceae, potentially opening new avenues for studying oxidative stress.","2022-08-09","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","2986-2999","","16","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000797591500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;79</p>","","","BIOTECHNOLOGY; DINOFLAGELLATE; MICROADRIATICUM FREUDENTHAL; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SINGLET OXYGEN; SP NOV.; THECAL PLATES; THERMAL TOLERANCE; ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By contrast, the contribution of trace metals to the physiological performance of the coral holobiont and, in turn, the functional ecology of reef-building corals remains unclear. The coral holobiont's trace metal economy is a network of supply, demand, and exchanges upheld by cross-kingdom symbiotic partnerships. Each partner has unique trace metal requirements that are central to their biochemical functions and the metabolic stability of the holobiont. Organismal homeostasis and the exchanges among partners determine the ability of the coral holobiont to adjust to fluctuating trace metal supplies in heterogeneous reef environments. This review details the requirements for trace metals in core biological processes and describes how metal exchanges among holobiont partners are key to sustaining complex nutritional symbioses in oligotrophic environments. Specifically, we discuss how trace metals contribute to partner compatibility, ability to cope with stress, and thereby to organismal fitness and distribution. Beyond holobiont trace metal cycling, we outline how the dynamic nature of the availability of environmental trace metal supplies can be influenced by a variability of abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, light, pH, etc.). Climate change will have profound consequences on the availability of trace metals and further intensify the myriad stressors that influence coral survival. Lastly, we suggest future research directions necessary for understanding the impacts of trace metals on the coral holobiont symbioses spanning subcellular to organismal levels, which will inform nutrient cycling in coral ecosystems more broadly. Collectively, this cross-scale elucidation of the role of trace metals for the coral holobiont will allow us to improve forecasts of future coral reef function.","2023-04","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","623-642","","2","98","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000888139300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;261</p>","","","ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE; coral reef; dinoflagellate; ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION; GLUTATHIONE-PEROXIDASE; IRON AVAILABILITY; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; microbiome; micronutrients; physiology; SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; STYLOPHORA-PISTILLATA; SUBMARINE GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; SYMBIODINIUM-MICROADRIATICUM FREUDENTHAL; symbiosis; SYMBIOTIC DINOFLAGELLATE; trace metals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The oxidative bleaching hypothesis posits that extreme temperatures lead to accumulation of photobiont-derived reactive oxygen species ROS, which exacerbates the coral environmental stress response (ESR). To understand how photosymbiosis modulates coral ESRs, these responses must be explored in hosts in and out of symbiosis. We leveraged the facultatively symbiotic coral Astrangia poculata, which offers an opportunity to uncouple the ESR across its two symbiotic phenotypes (brown, white). Colonies of both symbiotic phenotypes were exposed to three temperature treatments for 15 days: (i) control (static 18 degrees C), (ii) heat challenge (increasing from 18 to 30 degrees C), and (iii) cold challenge (decreasing from 18 to 4 degrees C) after which host gene expression was profiled. Cold challenged corals elicited widespread differential expression, however, there were no differences between symbiotic phenotypes. In contrast, brown colonies exhibited greater gene expression plasticity under heat challenge, including enrichment of cell cycle pathways involved in controlling photobiont growth. While this plasticity was greater, the genes driving this plasticity were not associated with an amplified environmental stress response (ESR) and instead showed patterns of a dampened ESR under heat challenge. This provides nuance to the oxidative bleaching hypothesis and suggests that, at least during the early onset of bleaching, photobionts reduce the host's ESR under elevated temperatures in A. poculata.","2024-07-05","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001263443800039","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;0<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;97</p>","","","ASTRANGIA-POCULATA; BLEACHED CORALS; Climate change; Coral; Environmental stress; EXPERIMENTAL ECOLOGY; GROWTH-RATE; LESION RECOVERY; MODEL; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; Symbiosis; TEMPERATE CORAL; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlation heatmaps and generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to explore the variations in major phytoplankton groups and their relationships to temperature, salinity, depth, and nutrients. The results indicated that the phytoplankton community structure was significantly different between 2018/2019 and 2020. Under the conditions of high dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and low dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) concentrations in winter 2020, cryptophytes replaced diatoms as the dominant species and were observed for the first time in this study area. Dinoflagellates predominated throughout the euphotic zone in spring 2020, and statistical analysis showed that dinoflagellates tended to prevail at low DIP and high DIN conditions compared with diatoms. Summer was the only season with strong water stratification that reoccurred every year, and diatoms were mainly concentrated at nutrient-enriched 1% light depths in the summers of 2018/2019. However, a large amount of Changjiang River Diluted Water (CDW) from the surface and western part of the study area affected all sampling sites eastward to 126 degrees E in 2020, allowing diatoms to be dominant at 100% and 30% light depths in the westernmost stations in the NECS. In autumn 2020, diatoms decreased significantly because of DIP-limited environmental conditions and were replaced by small phytoplankton. Under expected warming ocean scenarios with human-induced nutrient inputs, small phytoplankton will become dominant, while spring dinoflagellate blooms will occur more frequently in the NECS.

Juvenile corals associated with Symbiodinium from the warmer reef grew rapidly when exposed to 32 degrees C, yet underwent bleaching and tissue death when associated with Symbiodinium from the cooler reef. These results demonstrate that Symbiodinium types can adapt to local differences in thermal climate and that this adaptation shapes the fitness of coral hosts. If Symbiodinium populations are able to further adapt to increases in temperature at the pace at which ocean climates warm, they may assist corals to increase their thermal tolerance and persist into the future.","2012-02","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","116-120","","2","2","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000300520100024","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;325<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;361<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;30</p>","","","ALGAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; BLEACHING EVENT; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; HOST; POPULATIONS; SPECIFICITY; STABILITY; SYMBIODINIUM; SYMBIONTS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using tissue-specific transcriptomics, we determined how symbiosis affects expression of cell cycle-associated genes, in the model symbiotic cnidarian Exaiptasia diaphana (Aiptasia). The presence of symbionts within the gastrodermis elicited cell-cycle arrest in the G(1) phase in a larger proportion of host cells compared with the aposymbiotic gastrodermis. The symbiotic gastrodermis also showed a reduction in the amount of cells synthesizing their DNA and progressing through mitosis when compared with the aposymbiotic gastrodermis. Host apoptotic inhibitors (Mdm2) were elevated, while host apoptotic sensitizers (c-Myc) were depressed, in the symbiotic gastrodermis when compared with the aposymbiotic gastrodermis and epidermis of symbiotic anemones, respectively. This indicates that the presence of symbionts negatively regulates host apoptosis, possibly contributing to their persistence within the host. Transcripts (ATM/ATR) associated with DNA damage were also downregulated in symbiotic gastrodermal tissues. In epidermal cells, a single gene (Mob1) required for mitotic completion was upregulated in symbiotic compared with aposymbiotic anemones, suggesting that the presence of symbionts in the gastrodermis stimulates host cell division in the epidermis. To further corroborate this hypothesis, we performed microscopic analysis using an S-phase indicator (EdU), allowing us to evaluate cell cycling in host cells. Our results confirmed that there were significantly more proliferating host cells in both the gastrodermis and epidermis in the symbiotic state compared with the aposymbiotic state. Furthermore, when comparing between tissue layers in the presence of symbionts, the epidermis had significantly more proliferating host cells than the symbiont-containing gastrodermis. These results contribute to our understanding of the influence of symbionts on the mechanisms of cnidarian cell proliferation and mechanisms associated with symbiont maintenance.","2022-05-23","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000807652500001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;7<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;133</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL; DNA-REPLICATION; DOWN-REGULATION; G(1) ARREST; MDM2 PROMOTES; PROTEIN-DEGRADATION; SEA-ANEMONE; STRESS; UBIQUITIN LIGASE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This genus contains considerable genetic diversity and a corresponding range of physiological and ecological traits. Most genetic variation arises through the accumulation of somatic mutations that arise during asexual reproduction. Yet growing evidence suggests that occasional sexual reproductive events also occur within, and perhaps between, Symbiodinium lineages, further contributing to the pool of genetic variation available for evolutionary adaptation. Intra-genomic variation can therefore arise from both sexual and asexual reproductive processes, making it difficult to discern its underlying causes and consequences. We used quantitative PCR targeting the ITS2 locus to estimate proportions of genetically homogeneous symbionts and intra-genomically variable Symbiodinium (IGV Symbiodinium) in the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis at Lord Howe Island, Australia. We then sampled colonies through time and at a variety of spatial scales to find out whether the distribution of these symbionts followed patterns consistent with niche partitioning. Estimated ratios of homogeneous to IGV Symbiodinium varied between colonies within sites (metres to tens of metres) and between sites separated by hundreds to thousands of metres, but remained stable within colonies through time. Symbiont ratios followed a temperature gradient, with the local thermal maximum emerging as a negative predictor for the estimated proportional abundance of IGV Symbiodinium. While this pattern may result from fine-scale spatial population structure, it is consistent with an increased susceptibility to thermal stress, suggesting that the evolutionary processes that generate IGV (such as inter-lineage recombination and the accumulation of somatic mutations at the ITS2 locus) may have important implications for the fitness of the symbiont and that of the coral host.","2016-06","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","565-576","","2","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000376244600020","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;66</p>","","","CLADE-D; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Coral; CORAL-ALGAL SYMBIOSIS; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; GENETIC-VARIATION; Intra-genomic variation; ITS2; Pocillopora damicornis; REEF CORALS; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; Symbiodinium; SYMBIODINIUM; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Species of this genus have a worldwide distribution driven by environmental conditions (temperature, irradiance, salinity, nutrients etc.), and these factors are sensitive to climate change. The D. acuminata-complex may contain several species, including D. sacculus. The latter has been found in estuaries and semi-enclosed areas, water bodies subjected to quick salinity variations and its natural repartition suggests some tolerance to salinity changes.

Here, a 24 h hypoosmotic (25) and hyperosmotic (42) stress was performed in vitro in a metabolomic study carried out with three cultivated strains of D. cf. sacculus isolated from the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Growth rate, biovolume and osmolyte (proline, glycine betaine and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)) and toxin contents were measured. Osmolyte contents were higher at the highest salinity, but only a significant increase in glycine betaine was observed between the control (35) and the hyperosmotic treatment. Metabolomics revealed significant and strain-dependent differences in metabolite profiles for different salinities. These results, as well as the absence of effects on growth rate, biovolume, okadaic acid (OA) and pectenotoxin (PTXs) cellular contents, suggest that the D. cf. sacculus strains studied are highly tolerant to salinity variations.","2021-07","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","107","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000691548100005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;90</p>","","","CULTURE; DIMETHYLSULFONIOPROPIONATE; Dinoflagellates; DMSP; FORTII; Glycine betaine; GLYCINE BETAINE; MARINE; MIXOTROPHIC DINOFLAGELLATE; Okadaic acid; OKADAIC ACID; OSMOTIC-STRESS; Pectenotoxins; Proline; SEASONAL VARIABILITY; SPP.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cryopreservation is an indispensable tool for the preservation of species, as well as the establishment of a gene bank. However, the development of cryopreservation techniques for application to symbiotic algae is limited, in addition to the scarceness of related studies on the molecular level impacts post-thawing. Hence, it is essential to set up a suitable freezing protocol for coral symbionts, as well as to analyze its cryo-injury at the molecular level. The objective of this study was to develop a suitable protocol for the coral symbiont Breviolum subjected to two-step freezing. The thawed Breviolum were then cultured for 3, 7, 14, and 28 days before they were analyzed by Western blot for protein expression, light-harvesting protein (LHP), and red fluorescent protein (RFP) and tested by adenosine triphosphate bioassay for cell viability. The results showed the highest cell viability for thawed Breviolum that was treated with 2 M propylene glycol (PG) and 2 M methanol (MeOH) and equilibrated with both cryoprotectants for 30 min and 20 min. Both treatment groups demonstrated a significant increase in cell population after 28 days of culture post-thawing, especially for the MeOH treatment group, whose growth rate was twice of the PG treatment group. Regarding protein expression, the total amounts of each type of protein were significantly affected by cryopreservation. After 28 days of culture, the protein expression for the MeOH treatment group showed no significant difference to that of the control group, whereas the protein expression for the PG treatment group showed a significant difference. Breviolum that were frozen with MeOH recovered faster upon thawing than those frozen with PG. LHP was positively and RFP was negatively correlated with Symbiodiniaceae viability and so could serve as health-informing biomarkers. This work represents the first time to document it in Symbiodiniaceae, and this study established a suitable protocol for the cryopreservation of Breviolum and further refined the current understanding of the impact of low temperature on its protein expression. By gaining further understanding of the use of cryopreservation as a way to conserve Symbiodiniaceae, we hope to make an effort in the remediation and conservation of the coral reef ecosystem and provide additional methods to rescue coral reefs.","2021-08","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","8","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000689984400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;54</p>","","","CHLAMYDOMONAS; CHLOROPHYLL; coral; cryopreservation; CRYOPROTECTANTS; MICROALGAE; protein expression; RED FLUORESCENT PROTEIN; STRESS CAUSES; Symbiodiniaceae; two-step freezing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The genus Symbiodinium contains nine clades, some of which behave differently in response to strong light and/or temperature stresses, for example, clade D Symbiodinium are thermally tolerant. However, previous studies are based on corals present in the field, and it is possible that the corals used in previous experiments did not contain single Symbiodinium clades. For an accurate assessment of the effects of each Symbiodinium clade on host thermal stress resistance, monoclonal cultures of clades C1 and D were inoculated into aposymbiotic juvenile polyps. Photosynthetic efficiency (maximum quantum yield: F-v/F-m) showed a decline at 30 degrees C than at 25 degrees C in both clades. Symbiodinium clade C1 showed a consistently higher rETRmax with larger fluctuations than clade D, with a lower survival rate of juveniles during thermal stress treatment. Under strong light exposure, corals containing clade C1 showed a greater decline in F-v/F-m (-74%), compared to decline in corals associated with clade D (-50%) after 3 hours. This is the first study to assess stress tolerances of juvenile corals in association with the monoclonal Symbiodinium clades C and D, and our results indicated greater tolerance of corals associated with clade D to strong light (500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). However, it is difficult to determine the impact of high-temperature stress on coral-algae symbiosis from photosynthetic activity. At high temperatures, clade C1 Symbiodinium exhibited high photosynthetic activity, but host survival rates were higher in corals associated with clade D Symbiodinium. Since clade C1 has a relatively high photosynthetic activity under high temperatures, clade C1 symbiosis at high temperatures might have a negative impact on corals compared with clade D.","2016","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","55","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000399617200019","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;19<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;33</p>","","","Acropora; ALGAL SYMBIONT COMMUNITIES; Clade C1; Clade D; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIVERSITY; Endosymbiosis; HAWAII; PAM; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; REEF-BUILDING CORALS; STABILITY; Symbodinium; TEMPERATURES; ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sea anemones were collected from intertidal sandy flat and three meters subtidal areas. The results showed that all sea anemones contained clade C Symbiodinium. Advantages provided by clade C, have encouraged sea anemones in intertidal and subtidal areas to harbor clade C rather than clade D that has shown to have negative effects on the energetics of the reef corals by reducing their fitness. Given the prevailing harsh environmental conditions with regard to warm water (exceeding 36 degrees C in summers) and salinity (up to similar to 50 h) in the Persian Gulf, it seems that both Symbiodinium and the sea anemones are locally adapted. The findings from the present study suggest that ambient environmental parameters might play a key role in dictating sea anemones to host a symbiotic alga preferably the type that increases their fitness.

There is increasing evidence of functional significance to Symbiodinium diversity, which affects the coral holobiont's response to changing environmental conditions. For example, corals hosting Symbiodinium from the clade D taxon exhibit greater resistance to heat-induced coral bleaching than conspecifics hosting the more common clade C. Yet, the relatively low prevalence of clade D suggests that this trait is not advantageous in non-stressful environments. Thus, clade D may only be able to out-compete other Symbiodinium types within the host habitat when conditions are chronically stressful. Previous studies have observed enhanced photosynthesis and fitness by clade C holobionts at non-stressful temperatures, relative to clade D. Yet, carbon-centered metrics cannot account for enhanced growth rates and patterns of symbiont succession to other genetic types when nitrogen often limits reef productivity. To investigate the metabolic costs of hosting thermally tolerant symbionts, we examined the assimilation and translocation of inorganic N-15 and C-13 in the coral Acropora tenuis experimentally infected with either clade C (sub-type C1) or D Symbiodinium at 28 and 30 degrees C. We show that at 28 degrees C, C1 holobionts acquired 22% more N-15 than clade D. However, at 30 degrees C, C1 symbionts acquired equivalent nitrogen and 16% less carbon than D. We hypothesize that C1 competitively excludes clade D in hospite via enhanced nitrogen acquisition and thus dominates coral populations despite warming oceans.","2013-06","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","1248-1251","","6","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000319333600018","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;109<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;119<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;19</p>","","","CLIMATE-CHANGE; coral; DYNAMICS; FIELD; nitrogen; REEF CORALS; stable isotopes; Symbiodinium; symbiosis; temperature; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To better understand C. polykrikoides bloom at high WTs in 2018, we conducted field survey and laboratory experiments (the physiological and genetic differences between the two strains, CP2013 and CP2018). The heatwave increased the WT from 24.1 degrees C to 29.2 degrees C for two weeks, leading to strong stratification even in mid July (p < 0.01, Chi square = 94.656, Kruskal-Wallis test). Under early stratification conditions, patch blooms formed more earlier than the average outbreak in the last 17 years in KCW, despite high WT reaching 30 degrees C. In laboratory experiments, although there were no genetic differences in the LSU rDNA, both strains showed a significant different growth response to high WTs; above 28 degrees C, CP2013 did not survive, but CP2018 was able to grow, suggesting that CP2018 had potential growth capacity at high WTs. However, the growth rate and yield of the culture (CP2018) were lowered at 30 degrees C. Also, the blooms of C. polykrikoides in 2018 lasted only 3 weeks, which is unusual short compared to the average duration since 2002. The negative correlation between the average WT and duration of C. polykrikoides bloom in previous 17 years (R-2 = 0.518, p < 0.01) supports that high WT approaching 30 degrees C is not favorable for C. polykrikoides in KCW.

Each dinoflagellate species grows well at a certain optimal temperature but dies at very cold and hot temperatures. Thus, changes in water temperatures driven by global warming and extremely high or low temperatures can affect the distribution of dinoflagellates. Yihiella yeosuensis is a mixotrophic dinoflagellate that can feed on only the cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia and the chlorophyte Pyramimonas sp. Furthermore, it grows fast mixotrophically but rarely grows photosynthetically. We explored the direct and indirect effects of water temperature on the growth and ingestion rates of Y. yeosuensis feeding on T. amphioxeia and the growth rates of T. amphioxeia and Pyramimonas sp. under 7 different water temperatures (535 degrees C). Both the autotrophic and mixotrophic growth rates of Y. yeosuensis on T. amphioxeia were significantly affected by temperature. Under the mixotrophic and autotrophic conditions, Y. yeosuensis survived at 10-25 degrees C, but died at 5 degrees C and >= 30 degrees C. The maximum mixotrophic growth rate of Y. yeosuensis on T. amphioxeia (1.16 d(-1)) was achieved at 25 degrees C, whereas the maximum autotrophic growth rate (0.16 d(-1)) was achieved at 15 degrees C. The maximum ingestion rate of Y. yeosuensis on T. amphioxeia (0.24 ng C predator(-1) d(-1)) was achieved at 25 degrees C. The cells of T. amplitoxela survived at 10-25 degrees C, but died at 5 and >= 30 degrees C. The cells of Pyramimonas sp. survived at 5-25 degrees C, but died at 30 degrees C. The maximum growth rate of T. amphioxeia (0.72 d(-1)) and Pyramimonas sp. (0.75 d(-1)) was achieved at 25 degrees C. The abundance of Y. yeosuensis is expected to be high at 25 degrees C, at which its two prey species have their highest growth rates, whereas Y. yeosuensis is expected to be rare or absent at 5 degrees C or >= 30 degrees C at which its two prey species do not survive or grow. Therefore, temperature can directly or indirectly affect the population dynamics and distribution of Y. yeosuensis.","2020-09","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","263-275","","3","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000574269300005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;65</p>","","","BIECHELERIOPSIS-ADRIATICA SUESSIACEAE; Chlorophyte; COMMON HETEROTROPHIC PROTISTS; cryptophyte; DINOPHYCEAE; feeding; FRAGILIDIUM-SUBGLOBOSUM; harmful algal bloom; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; IRRADIANCE; KOREAN COASTAL WATERS; LIGHT-INTENSITY; protist; red tide; SALINITY; TROPHIC ROLE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Determining species elemental quotas (their elementome) is a key indicator for their success across environments with different resource availabilities. Elementomes remain undescribed for functionally diverse dinoflagellates within the family Symbiodiniaceae that includes coral endosymbionts. We used dry combustion and ICP-MS to assess whether Symbiodiniaceae (ten isolates spanning five genera Breviolum, Cladocopium, Durusdinium, Effrenium, Symbiodinium) maintained under long-term nutrient replete conditions have unique elementomes (six key macronutrients and nine micronutrients) that would reflect evolutionarily conserved preferential elemental acquisition. For three isolates we assessed how elevated temperature impacted their elementomes. Further, we tested whether Symbiodiniaceae conform to common stoichiometric hypotheses (e.g., the growth rate hypothesis) documented in other marine algae. This study considers whether Symbiodiniaceae isolates possess unique elementomes reflective of their natural ecologies, evolutionary histories, and resistance to environmental change. Results Symbiodiniaceae isolates maintained under long-term luxury uptake conditions, all exhibited highly divergent elementomes from one another, driven primarily by differential content of micronutrients. All N:P and C:P ratios were below the Redfield ratio values, whereas C:N was close to the Redfield value. Elevated temperature resulted in a more homogenised elementome across isolates. The Family-level elementome was (C19.8N2.6 P1.0S18.8K0.7Ca0.1) center dot 1000 (Fe55.7Mn5.6Sr2.3Zn0.8Ni0.5Se0.3Cu0.2Mo0.1V0.04) mmol Phosphorous(-1) versus (C25.4N3.1P1.0S23.1K0.9Ca0.4) center dot 1000 (Fe66.7Mn6.3Sr7.2Zn0.8Ni0.4Se0.2Cu0.2Mo0.2V0.05) mmol Phosphorous (-1) at 27.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 30.7 +/- 0.01 degrees C, respectively. Symbiodiniaceae isolates tested here conformed to some, but not all, stoichiometric principles. Conclusions Elementomes for Symbiodiniaceae diverge from those reported for other marine algae, primarily via lower C:N:P and different micronutrient expressions. Long-term maintenance of Symbiodiniaceae isolates in culture under common nutrient replete conditions suggests isolates have evolutionary conserved preferential uptake for certain elements that allows these unique elementomes to be identified. Micronutrient content (normalised to phosphorous) commonly increased in the Symbiodiniaceae isolates in response to elevated temperature, potentially indicating a common elemental signature to warming.","2022-04-09","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000781383700003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;89</p>","","","C-N-P; CELL-SIZE; Dinoflagellates; Elemental phenotyping; Elementome; EVOLUTIONARY INHERITANCE; GROWTH; Macronutrients; Micronutrients; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHYTOPLANKTON; Redfield ratio; REEF CORALS; STOICHIOMETRY; Symbiodiniaceae; TEMPERATURE; THERMAL SENSITIVITY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Crypthecodinium cohnii, a marine heterotrophic dinoflagellate, is successfully used for the industrial production of DHA because it can accumulate DHA at high concentrations within the cells. Glycerol is an interesting renewable substrate for DHA production since it is a by-product of biodiesel production and other industries, and is globally generated in large quantities. The DHA production potential from glycerol, ethanol and glucose is compared by combining fermentation experiments with the pathway-scale kinetic modeling and constraint-based stoichiometric modeling of C. cohnii metabolism. Glycerol has the slowest biomass growth rate among the tested substrates. This is partially compensated by the highest PUFAs fraction, where DHA is dominant. Mathematical modeling reveals that glycerol has the best experimentally observed carbon transformation rate into biomass, reaching the closest values to the theoretical upper limit. In addition to our observations, the published experimental evidence indicates that crude glycerol is readily consumed by C. cohnii, making glycerol an attractive substrate for DHA production.","2022-02","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000765093400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;63</p>","","","central metabolism; COMPLEX; constraint-based model; CONSTRAINTS; COPASI; FTIR spectroscopy; kinetic model; Krebs cycle; OPTIMIZATION; POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Responses of marine protists to increased levels of CO2 are highly species-specific, and this has been suggested to cause an alteration in plankton species composition, community functions and ultimately biogeochemical cycles. This study aims to test this by performing microcosm incubation experiments at present (pH 8.0) and at three lowered pH levels (pH 7.8, 7.6 and 6.0), corresponding to free CO2 concentrations of 24, 38, 58 610 mu mol l-1, respectively. Results from two such experiments are reported, and measurements include microscopy counts of similar to 0 planktonic protist taxa, HPLC pigment analysis, FlowCAM analysis of cell-size spectra, photosynthetic activity and total POC and PON. Initial communities were flagellate (experiment 1) and dinoflagellate and ciliate (experiment 2) dominated, but at pH 8.0, 7.8 and 7.6 a diatom dominance developed during the first days in both experiments. Profound changes in all measured parameters were found as a result of the pH 6.0 treatment, but among the other three pH treatments significant differences were few; Karlodinium spp. was the only taxon to be affected significantly, and plankton group composition, cell sizes and photosynthetic activity all remained unaffected during the 14-day incubation periods. Thus, both of the investigated coastal plankton communities were unaffected by twenty-first century expected changes in pH and free CO2. This may be explained by the large seasonal, and even daily, changes in pH seen in productive marine ecosystems, and the corresponding need for algae to be pH-tolerant.","2010","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","542-555","","6","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000282581100003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;57<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;59<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;46</p>","","","CALCIFICATION; CARBON ACQUISITION; Climate change; EMILIANIA-HUXLEYI PRYMNESIOPHYCEAE; FlowCAM and pH; GROWTH-RATE; HIGH PH; INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC CO2; IRRADIANCE; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; OCEAN; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; pigment analysis; seawater acidification; species composition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each eddy had a unique microzooplankton assemblage that did not conform to the expectations of downwelling and upwelling eddies. The warm-core (WC) eddy was similar to 130km in diameter and was well mixed to similar to 250m in the centre, while the cold-core (CC) eddy was smaller (similar to 100 km) and had a warm cap and a well-developed deep chlorophyll a maximum (DCM). Both eddies had formed within the Leeuwin Current at the continental shelf break off Western Australia. Total microzooplankton biomass ranged from 0.5 to 3.8pgCL(-1), and was significantly (F-(1,F-10) = 5.6, p<0.05) greater in the WC eddy. The WC eddy contained a significant population of large diatoms, which were grazed by dinoflagellates; the CC eddy resembled a nutrient-limited, oceanic environment with small phytoplankton cells (90% < 5 mu m) and was dominated by ciliates. The growth rate of phytoplankton derived from dilution experiments using chlorophyll a analysis ranged between -0.09 and 0.12 d(-1), and phytoplankton mortality due to microzooplankton grazing was between 0 and 0.23 d(-1). The growth rate of specific picoplankton genera, using significant flow-cytometry data, ranged between 0 and 1.3 d(-1), and mortality due to microzooplankton grazing ranged between 0 and 0.42 d(-1). In most cases there was a close balance between growth and mortality in both eddies. Although the eddies differed in their physico-chemical properties and community structures, microzooplankton grazing could account for > 100% of primary production in experiments from both eddies. However, the structure of the phytoplankton and microzooplankton assemblages were not typical for either up- or downwelling eddies, and as such the fate of organic carbon will not reflect that of classic eddies.

Small changes in temperature can change the flow of carbon and the community structure of planktonic ecosystems, and climatological models predict a rise in temperature of 2 to 5 degrees C toward the end of the century in the NW Mediterranean. Laboratory culture experiments have shown that warming can increase the transfer of carbon between bacteria and protists and alter the community composition of microbial top predators (i.e. ciliates and dinoflagellates) by increasing the abundance of bacterivores and producing the extinction of herbivores. Here, we tested whether a small rise in temperature would produce these effects in the coastal Mediterranean. Between March 2003 and February 2004, we established 12 microcosm experiments with water from the Bay of Blanes. The samples were incubated for 48 h at ambient and warmer temperatures (similar to 2.7 degrees C higher than in situ values), and the net and gross growth rates of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) were measured using unfiltered and 0.8 mu m filtered treatments. Warming increased the rates of bacterial gross production and bacterial losses to grazing with a clear seasonality; the largest increments in the rates were observed during the cooler months of the year. Warming did not change the net growth rates of dinoflagellates. It decreased the net production of HNF and the net growth rates of ciliates but did not promote the extinction of herbivorous protists. Temperature changed the microbial food web function in NW Mediterranean waters, with small alterations in the community composition of microbial top predators.","2012","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","107-121","","2","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000310006400002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;34<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;38<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;74</p>","","","Carbon cycle; CARBON FLUX; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; FOOD CONCENTRATION; Function and structure; GRAZING LOSSES; GROWTH-RATE; MARINE; Microbial food web; NW Mediterranean; OCEAN PHYTOPLANKTON; PLANKTONIC BACTERIA; SPRING BLOOM; Temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite its widespread occurrence and significance in microbial cycling, knowledge of the seasonality of this compound is lacking. Here, we present a seasonal dataset of GBT concentrations in marine suspended particulate material. Analysing coastal waters in the Western English Channel, GBT peaked in summer and autumn but did not follow the observed maxima in total phytoplankton biomass or chlorophyll a. Instead, we found evidence that GBT concentrations were associated with specific phytoplankton groups or species, particularly in the summer when GBT correlated with dinoflagellate biomass. In contrast, autumn maxima corresponded with a period of rapidly changing salinity and nutrient availability, with potential contributions from some phytoplankton species and Harpacticoid copepods. This suggests distinct environmental drivers for different periods of the GBT seasonality. Building on evidence that GBT and dinoflagellate biomass peak in summer, concomitantly with low nutrients, we propose that GBT positively affects dinoflagellate fitness, allowing them to outcompete other plankton when inorganic nutrients are depleted. By using this assumption, we improved the performance of a marine ecosystem model to reproduce the observed increase in dinoflagellates biomass in the transition from spring to summer. This work sheds light on the interplay between phytoplankton succession, competitive advantage and changing environmental factors relevant to climate change. It paves the way for future multidisciplinary research aiming to understand the importance of dinoflagellates in key coastal ecosystems and their potential significance for methylamine production, compounds relevant for particle growth in atmospheric chemistry.","2023-02","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","309-323","","3","162","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000905456400001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;58</p>","","","AMINO-ACIDS; CHOLINE; DIMETHYLSULFONIOPROPIONATE DMSP; Dinoflagellates; Glycine betaine; Marine; METABOLISM; NUCLEATION; OCEAN; Osmolytes; Phytoplankton; PHYTOPLANKTON; SEAWATER; TRIMETHYLAMINE; Western Channel Observatory; ZOOPLANKTON","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used a Bayesian biphasic generalized logistic model to estimate key parameters of the growth of five strains of cultured Symbiodinium, S. microadriaticum (cp-type A194; strain 04-503), S. microadriaticum (cp-type A194; strain CassKB8), S. minutum (cp-type B184; strain Mf 1.05b.01.SCI.01), S. psygmophilum (cp-type B224; strain Mf 11.05b.01) and S. trenchii (cptype D206; strain Mf 2.2b), grown in four different combinations of temperature and light. Growth kinetics varied among Symbiodinium strains and across treatments. Biphasic growth was especially evident for S. minutum and S. psygmophilum across all treatments. Monophasic growth was more common when final asymptotic densities were relatively low (similar to 200 million cells ml(-1)). All species tended to grow faster and / or reached a higher asymptote at 26 degrees C than at 18 degrees C. The fastest growth was exhibited by S. minutum, with an approximate four-fold increase in estimated cell density after 60 days. The strongest effect of light was seen in S. trenchii, in which increasing light levels resulted in a decrease in initial growth rate, and an increase in asymptotic density, time when growth rate was at its maximum, final growth rate, and maximum growth rate.

In several parts of the Baltic Sea, however, cold-water dinoflagellates such as Biecheleria baltica have become dominant during the past decades. We have investigated the mechanisms behind this trend by using an ecosystem model which includes the life cycles of three main phytoplankton groups (diatoms, dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria). Coupled to a water column model we have applied the model system for the period 1981-2010 to the Gulf of Finland. In agreement with observations, the model results show an increasing trend in the proportion of dinoflagellates in the Gulf of Finland. Temperature and life cycle-related processes explain the relative increase of dinoflagellates and corresponding decrease of diatoms. Warming over the 30 years has enabled a head start of dinoflagellates by reducing the time lag between germination and growth of vegetative cells. Although diatoms have a much higher growth rate, they cannot compete with the high dinoflagellate concentrations that result from the inoculum. Diatoms will only dominate in years when the inoculum concentrations of dinoflagellates or the temperatures are low. Overall, the model results suggest that consideration of life cycle dynamics of competing phytoplankton groups may be crucial to understand trends and shifts in community composition.","2018-02","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","75-85","","","178","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000418215000007","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>","","","Baltic Sea; BALTIC SEA; Cold-water dinoflagellates; COMMUNITIES; Diatoms; DINOFLAGELLATE SCRIPPSIELLA-HANGOEI; DINOPHYCEAE; DYNAMICS; ENCYSTMENT; Life cycle; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS; Resting stages; Seed pool; SINKING; Spring bloom; STRATEGIES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a population model for A. ocellatum infecting spotted seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus and red snapper Lutjanus campechanus and evaluates the relative effect of each vital rate on the A. ocellatum population growth rate. The vital rates were estimated by incubating trophonts in vitro and tracking their development through the successive life history stages at 25 degrees C and 33 ppt. The A. ocellatum population growth rate was 1.90 d(-1) for spotted seatrout and 1.92 d(-1) for red snapper. Highest elasticity values (0.24 and 0.23 in spotted seatrout and red snapper, respectively) corresponded to transitions from the dinospore to the trophont stage, the trophont stage to the tomont stage and the tomont stage back to the dinospore stage in both host species (self-loops not included). A 50% change in vital rates showed that the mean number of dinospores produced by a tomont had the largest effect on the A. ocellatum population growth rate (15%), followed by the dinospore infection rate (14%), the tomont sporulation rate (12%) and the dinospore mortality rate (10%) in both host species. A comparison of modeled and experimental vital rate threshold values revealed a 2.5-(spotted seatrout) or a 2.6-fold (red snapper) difference in the values for dinospore mortality, which is the smallest difference among all the modeled and experimental vital rates. Therefore, measures that increase dinospore mortality have a greater likelihood of influencing the outcome of an epidemic.","2013-10-11","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","139-148","","2","106","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000325652600005","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;8<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;33</p>","","","Amyloodiniosis; Amyloodinium ocellatum; BROWN 1931; DINOFLAGELLIDA; ECTOPARASITE; Epidemic model; EPIDEMICS; Epidemiology; Fish disease; IMMUNITY; PARASITE; Population model; Red snapper; Spotted seatrout; STRESS; TOLERANCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such differences in symbiont metabolite contribution and host utilization may limit the proliferation of stress-driven symbioses; this contributes valuable information towards future scenarios that select in favour of less-competent symbionts in response to environmental change.","2018-11-28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","1892","285","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000452355700013","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;74<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;82<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;84</p>","","","Aiptasia; ALGAE; ASSIMILATION; autotrophy; CARBON FATE; cnidarian; CORALS; FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; HOST; metabolomics; PLASTICITY; Symbiodiniaceae; SYMBIODINIUM; symbiosis specificity; THERMAL-STRESS; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the effects of two emerging environmental threats (ocean acidification and warming) on marine DMS production, we performed a large-scale perturbation experiment in a coastal environment. At both ambient temperature and similar to 2 degrees C warmer, an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in seawater (160-830 ppmv pCO(2)) favored the growth of large diatoms, which outcompeted other phytoplankton species in a natural phytoplankton assemblage and reduced the growth rate of smaller, DMSP-rich phototrophic dinoflagellates. This decreased the grazing rate of heterotrophic dinoflagellates (ubiquitous micrograzers), resulting in reduced DMS production via grazing activity. Both the magnitude and sign of the effect of pCO(2) on possible future oceanic DMS production were strongly linked to pCO(2)-induced alterations to the phytoplankton community and the cellular DMSP content of the dominant species and its association with micrograzers.","2014-05-06","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","4750-4756","","9","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000335720100015","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;37<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;39<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;39</p>","","","DIMETHYLSULFONIOPROPIONATE DMSP; DIMETHYLSULPHONIOPROPIONATE; GROWTH; MESOCOSM; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; PERTURBATION EXPERIMENTS; PHYTOPLANKTON; SULFUR; VOLUME","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rate estimates were made at three different temperatures in situ (0 degrees C), +3 degrees C and +6 degrees C over ambient. In situ Chlorophyll a (Chl a) doubled during the observation period to similar to 12 mu g Chl a L-1, with 60-97% of CM a in the >20 mu m size-fraction dominated by the diatom genus Chaetoceros. Herbivorous dinoflagellates comprised 60-80% of microplankton grazer biomass. At in situ temperatures, phytoplankton growth or grazing by herbivorous predators <200 mu m was not measurable until 11 days after observations commenced. Thereafter, phytoplankton growth was on average 0.25 d(-1). Phytoplankton mortality due to herbivorous grazing was only measured on three occasions but the magnitude was substantial, up to 0.58 d(-1). Grazing of this magnitude removed similar to 100% of primary production. In short-term temperature-shift incubation experiments, phytoplankton growth rate increased significantly (20%) at elevated temperatures. In contrast, herbivorous protist grazing and species-specific growth rates decreased significantly (50%) at +6 degrees C. This differential response in phytoplankton and herbivores to temperature increases resulted in a decrease of primary production removed with increasing temperature. Phaeocystis spp. abundance was negatively correlated with bulk grazing rate. Growth and grazing rates were variable but showed no evidence of an inherent, low temperature limitation. Herbivorous protist growth rates in this study and in a literature review were comparable to rates from temperate waters. Thus, an inherent physiological inhibition of protistan growth or grazing rates in polar waters is not supported by the data. The large variability between lack of grazing and high rates of primary production removal observed here and confirmed in the literature for polar waters implies larger amplitude fluctuations in phytoplankton biomass than slower, steady grazing losses of primary production.","2018-07-23","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000439652700002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;33<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;39<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;105</p>","","","ANNUAL POPULATION DEVELOPMENT; Arctic ecosystem; Arctic warming; CENTRAL BARENTS SEA; DISKO BAY; Food-web dynamics; Grazing; Heterotrophic protists; HETEROTROPHIC PROTISTS; MARGINAL ICE-ZONE; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; MICROZOOPLANKTON HERBIVORY; PLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; Plankton production; Spring bloom; STRATIFIED SUMMER SITUATION; Temperature response; WESTERN COAST","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The response of Symbiodinium spp. to environmental changes could dictate survival of their hosts and the ecological success of coral reef ecosystems. Oxidative stress has been linked to a breakdown in this symbiotic relationship, known as bleaching. Increased temperature is one of the primary environmental changes linked to this phenomenon. Preliminary studies have established high concentrations of the sulfur compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in Symbiodinium spp., with increased temperature. To examine the potential use of DMSP as an antioxidant, a 5 day incubation experiment was conducted at two temperatures with the algae S. microadriaticum (CCMP1633) isolated from the cnidarian host Aiptasia pulchella. An HPLC assay for the activity of the enzyme B-12-dependent methionine synthase was modified and used to determine the link between de novo production of methionine, a precursor to DMSP, and temperature induced oxidative stress. DMSP concentrations per cell increased approximately 38 % in the 33 A degrees C treatment cultures over 120 h. However, these cells also increased more than 2-fold in biovolume (127 +/- A 43 %), and SYTO-BC stain indicated increased DNA content (approximately 4-fold), suggesting arrested cell division. Normalization of DMSP to biovolume revealed that the concentrations actually decreased approximately 49 % after 2 days in cultures exposed to elevated temperature (33 A degrees C), but were not significantly different from the control treatment at 120 h (27 A degrees C). Concomitant changes in the 33 A degrees C treatment relative to the control (after 120 h) resulted in an approximately 8-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, a 37 % (+/- 7 %) decrease in photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II, and a 5-fold increase in xanthophyll cycling. Methionine synthase activity (MSA) correlated to the decrease in DMSP concentration (R (2) = 0.778), with decreasing activity at the high temperature. Given this decrease in MSA, the increase in DMSP per cell may be due to DMSP production utilizing methionine from protein turnover, and not de novo synthesis via MSA. The findings of this study provide insight into the responses of algal symbionts to environmental changes, shed light on the potential use of DMSP and other known photo-protective mechanisms such as xanthophyll cycling under temperature induced oxidative stress, and support the suspected cessation of cell division under these conditions. This information could be crucial to understanding cellular responses to environmental changes and the ability of these organisms to survive under elevated sea surface temperatures projected for the near future.","2012-09","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","17-29","","1-3","110","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000309227400003","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;26<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;29<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;55</p>","","","ALGAE; CELL-DEATH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DMSP; HOST; Methionine synthase; NITRIC-OXIDE; Oxidative stress; PHYTOPLANKTON; PROTEIN; RADIATION; SEA; STRESS; Symbiodinium; Xanthophyll","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One way in which we can begin to better tackle these challenges is to conduct community-wide scientific studies. This study provides physiological datasets fundamental to understanding functional responses of phytoplankton growth rates to temperature. While physiological experiments are not new, our experiments were conducted in many laboratories using agreed upon protocols and 25 strains of eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankton isolated across a wide range of marine environments from polar to tropical, and from nearshore waters to the open ocean. This community-wide approach provides both comprehensive and internally consistent datasets produced over considerably shorter time scales than conventional individual and often uncoordinated lab efforts. Such datasets can be used to parameterise global ocean model projections of environmental change and to provide initial insights into the magnitude of regional biogeographic change in ocean biota in the coming decades. Here, we compare our datasets with a compilation of literature data on phytoplankton growth responses to temperature. A comparison with prior published data suggests that the optimal temperatures of individual species and, to a lesser degree, thermal niches were similar across studies. However, a comparison of the maximum growth rate across studies revealed significant departures between this and previously collected datasets, which may be due to differences in the cultured isolates, temporal changes in the clonal isolates in cultures, and/or differences in culture conditions. Such methodological differences mean that using particular trait measurements from the prior literature might introduce unknown errors and bias into modelling projections. Using our community-wide approach we can reduce such protocol-driven variability in culture studies, and can begin to address more complex issues such as the effect of multiple environmental drivers on ocean biota.","2013-05-21","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000319330200019","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;250<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;283<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;105</p>","","","CYANOBACTERIA; DIATOM THALASSIOSIRA-ROTULA; DINOFLAGELLATE AKASHIWO-SANGUINEA; EMILIANIA-HUXLEYI; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; IRON; LATITUDINAL GRADIENT; LIGHT; NORTH-ATLANTIC; SOUTHERN-OCEAN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bacterial associates can regulate Symbiodiniaceae fitness in terms of growth, calcification and photophysiology. However, the influence of these bacteria on interactive stressors, such as temperature and light, which are known to influence Symbiodiniaceae physiology, remains unclear. Here, we examined the photophysiological response of two Symbiodiniaceae species (Symbiodinium microadriaticum and Breviolum minutum) cultured under acute temperature and light stress with specific bacterial partners from their microbiome (Labrenzia (Roseibium) alexandrii, Marinobacter adhaerens or Muricauda aquimarina). Overall, bacterial presence positively impacted Symbiodiniaceae core photosynthetic health (photosystem II [PSII] quantum yield) and photoprotective capacity (non-photochemical quenching; NPQ) compared to cultures with all extracellular bacteria removed, although specific benefits were variable across Symbiodiniaceae genera and growth phase. Symbiodiniaceae co-cultured with M. aquimarina displayed an inverse NPQ response under high temperatures and light, and those with L. alexandrii demonstrated a lowered threshold for induction of NPQ, potentially through the provision of antioxidant compounds such as zeaxanthin (produced by Muricauda spp.) and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP; produced by this strain of L. alexandrii). Our co-culture approach empirically demonstrates the benefits bacteria can deliver to Symbiodiniaceae photochemical performance, providing evidence that bacterial associates can play important functional roles for Symbiodiniaceae.","2023-11-25","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001117544000022","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>","","","BACTERIA; DINOFLAGELLATE; EVOLUTION; IRON-LIMITATION; LEAVES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHYTOPLANKTON; TEMPERATURE; TRANSPORT; ZEAXANTHIN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sedimentation rates of this dinoflagellate were followed concurrently by means of sediment traps with and without a preservative (Formalin), positioned at the base of the epilimnion and within the hypolimnion, for exposure periods of 2-3 weeks. Upper trap catches of total P. gatunense (live cells + dead cells + thecae + protoplasts + cysts) were nearly always higher than lower trap catches, partly due to decomposition of the cells as they sank through the water column. Over the 5-year period, total P. gatunense sedimentation rates ranged over 4 orders of magnitude, from values <0.001 to 8.5 g (WW) m(-2) d(-1). A typical seasonal pattern was observed in which sedimentation rates were relatively low during the bloom increase phase, with thecae (from cell, division) being the main component, and increased substantially after the peak of the bloom, when the relative contribution of senescent cells, dead cells and protoplasts increased substantially. Cysts were trapped in low numbers, usually 1-2 orders of magnitude fewer than live cells. Interannual variations in total P. gatunense sedimentation were large and independent of the size of bloom-the proportion of annual P. gatunense production reaching the hypolimnetic traps ranged from 6% in 1994, the year with the largest bloom, to 68% in 1991, a year with an average-size bloom. The high value was exceptional and we speculated that it resulted from higher resuspension and more severe nutrient limitation of microbial decomposition during that low water level, drought year. On average, thecae accounted for 75% of total P. gatunense sedimentation despite being only 55% of the P. gatunense-produced biomass, suggesting that thecae were more refractory or less grazed than protoplasts. Thecal C:N:P ratio of >3,000:19:1 (vs. 276:51:1 for protoplasts) indicated that microbial decomposition of thecae is likely to require N and P inputs from other sources. Ultimately, our study highlights for the first time that annual dinoflagellate sedimentation rates may vary dramatically as a result of other processes such as decomposition, resuspension, and grazing, leading to dramatic variations in the amount of organic matter reaching the bottom sediments.","1998-03","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","175-186","","2","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000073951900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;46<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;52<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;56</p>","","","CARBON FLOW; CINCTUM; DECOMPOSITION; FATE; FOOD-WEB; ISRAEL; PHAEOCYSTIS-POUCHETII; PHYTOPLANKTON; SINKING; SPRING BLOOM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we show that altering the bacterial composition of two widespread Symbiodiniaceae species, during their free-living stage, results in a significant shift in their cellular metabolism. Indeed, the abundance of monosaccharides and the key phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were correlated with the presence of specific bacteria, including members of the Labrenzia (Roseibium) and Marinobacter genera. Single-cell stable isotope tracking revealed that these two bacterial genera are involved in reciprocal exchanges of carbon and nitrogen with Symbiodiniaceae. We identified the provision of IAA by Labrenzia and Marinobacter, and this metabolite caused a significant growth enhancement of Symbiodiniaceae. By unravelling these interkingdom interactions, our work demonstrates how specific bacterial associates fundamentally govern Symbiodiniaceae fitness. A new study reveals that bacterial partners supply essential metabolites to the vital microalgal symbionts of corals, including metabolites that boost symbiont growth.

Increased ocean temperatures and light intensity trigger coral bleaching, the breakdown of the relationship between corals and their photosymbionts, dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae. This leaves corals without their primary energy source, thereby leading to starvation and, often, death. Coral bleaching is hypothesized to occur due to an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Symbiodiniaceae, which subsequently accumulate in coral tissues. Bacterial probiotics have been proposed as an approach to mitigate coral bleaching, by reducing ROS levels in the coral holobiont through bacterial antioxidant production. Both corals and Symbiodiniaceae are known to associate with bacteria. However, the Symbiodiniaceae-bacteria relationship, and its impact on Symbiodiniaceae thermal tolerance, remains a poorly studied area. In this study, cultured Symbiodiniaceae of the species Breviolum minutum were treated with antibiotics to reduce their bacterial load. The cultures were subsequently inoculated with bacterial isolates from the genus Roseovarius that were isolated from the same B. minutum culture and showed either high or low ROS-scavenging abilities. The B. minutum cultures were then exposed to experimental heat stress for 16 days, and their health was monitored through measurements of cell density and photochemical efficiency of photosystem II. It was found that B. minutum inoculated with Roseovarius with higher ROS-scavenging abilities showed greater cell growth at elevated temperatures, compared to cultures inoculated with a Roseovarius strain with lower ROS-scavenging abilities. This suggests that Roseovarius may play a role in Symbiodiniaceae fitness at elevated temperatures. Analysis of Symbiodiniaceae-associated bacterial communities through 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding revealed that Roseovarius relative abundance increased in B. minutum cultures following inoculation and with elevated temperature exposure, highlighting the contribution they may have in shielding B. minutum from thermal stress, although other bacterial community changes may have also contributed to these observations. This study begins to unpick the relationship between Symbiodiniaceae and their bacteria and opens the door for the use of Symbiodiniaceae-associated bacteria in coral reef conservation approaches.","2023-08-10","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001053994200001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;6<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;61</p>","","","bacteria; coral; DIMETHYLSULFONIOPROPIONATE; MICROBIOME; probiotics; reactive oxygen species; STRESS CAUSES; Symbiodiniaceae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings might explain the recurrent blooms of this species in Pearl River Estuary, China. Results showed that nutrient limitation significantly inhibited the growth of L. fissa. The values of specific growth rate (mu (max)) and half-saturation nutrient concentration (K (S)) were 0.37 divisions/d and 8.49 mu mol L-1 for N, and 0.39 divisions/d and 1.99 mu mol L-1 for P, respectively. Based on K (S) values, dissolved inorganic N level in PRE was sufficient to support the high proliferation of L. fissa, while dissolved inorganic P concentration was far lower than the minimum requirement for its effective growth. L. fissa was not able to utilize dissolved organic N (DON) compounds such as urea, amino acids, and uric acid. However, it grew well by using a wide variety of dissolved organic P (DOP) sources like nucleotides, glycerophosphate, and 4-nitrophenylphosphate. The results from this study suggested that the ability in DOP utilization of L. fissa offers this species a competitive advantage in phytoplankton communities. The high level and continuous supply of DIN, enrichment of DOP, together with warm climate and low salinity in the Pearl River Estuary provided a suitable nutrient niche for the growth of L. fissa, and resulted in the recurrent blooms in the estuary.","2017-02","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","114-120","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000392131500015","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;11<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;12<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;36</p>","","","ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY; COASTAL WATERS; DINOFLAGELLATE; DINOPHYCEAE; DISSOLVED ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; growth; Gyrodinium instriatum; GYRODINIUM-INSTRIATUM; KINETICS; Levanderina fissa; nitrogen; Pearl River Estuary; phosphorus; SALINITY; SOUTH CHINA SEA; TEMPERATURE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bleaching, i.e., the loss of pigment and the decrease in population density of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae), is often correlated with an increase or decrease in sea surface temperature. Because little is known of the cellular events concomitant with thermal bleaching, we have investigated the mechanism of release of zooxanthellae by the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the reef coral Pocillopora damicornis in response to cold and heat stress. Both species released intact host endoderm cells containing zooxanthellae. The majority of the released host cells were viable, but they soon disintegrated in the seawater leaving behind isolated zooxanthellae. The detachment and release of intact host cells suggests that thermal stress causes host cell adhesion dysfunction in these cnidarians. Knowledge of the cellular entity released by the host during bleaching provides insight into both the underlying release mechanism and the way in which natural environmental stresses evoke a bleaching response.","1992-06","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","324-332","","3","182","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:A1992KC97500004","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;390<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;465<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;57</p>","","","ADHESION; CYTOSKELETON; EVENT; HEAT-SHOCK; MONTASTREA-ANNULARIS; MORTALITY; REDUCED GROWTH-RATE; REEF CORALS; SEA-ANEMONE; TRANSITIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet this fragile association is highly vulnerable to environmental disturbance. A coral's ability to tolerate temperature stress depends on the fitness of its resident symbionts, whose thermal optima vary extensively between lineages. However, the in hospite population genetic structure of Symbiodinium is poorly understood and mostly based on analysis of bulk DNA extracted from thousands to millions of cells. Using quantitative single-cell PCR, we enumerated DNA polymorphisms in the symbionts of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis, and applied a model selection approach to explore the potential for recombination between coexisting Symbiodinium populations. Results: Two distinct Symbiodinium ITS2 sequences (denoted C100 and C109) were retrieved from all P. damicornis colonies analysed. However, the symbiont assemblage consisted of three distinct Symbiodinium populations: cells featuring pure arrays of ITS2 type C109, near-homogeneous cells of type C100 (with trace ITS2 copies of type C109), and those with co-dominant C100 and C109 ITS2 repeats. The symbiont consortia of some colonies consisted almost entirely of these putative C100 x C109 recombinants. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the occurrence of sexual recombination between Symbiodinium types C100 and C109. While the multiple-copy nature of the ITS2 dictates that the observed pattern of intra-genomic co-dominance may be a result of incomplete concerted evolution of intra-genomic polymorphisms, this is a less likely explanation given the occurrence of homogeneous cells of the C109 type. Conclusive evidence for inter-lineage recombination and introgression in this genus will require either direct observational evidence or a single-cell genotyping approach targeting multiple, single-copy loci.","2015-03-14","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000351897300001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;37<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;38<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;87</p>","","","CLADE-D; CLIMATE-CHANGE; Concerted evolution; CONCERTED EVOLUTION; Coral; CORAL-REEFS; DIVERSITY; DNA; ECOLOGY; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; ITS2; Pocillopora damicornis; Recombination; Sexual reproduction; Symbiodinium; SYMBIODINIUM; Symbiosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared the photophysiology and H2O2 production rates of Symbiodinium muscatinei and Elliptochloris marina, the dinoflagellate and chlorophyte symbionts, respectively, of the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Analyses of photosystem II (PSII) function in the two symbionts, including maximum quantum yield and relative electron transport rates, were consistent with prior studies indicating that E. marina has lower photosynthetic performance than S. muscatinei at high temperature and irradiance. The efficiency of PSII in both symbionts was positively affected by the addition of exogenous catalase, suggesting that both symbionts experience H2O2-mediated declines in PSII efficiency. We found that S. muscatinei produced more H2O2 than E. marina across all treatments, with the highest production under high light and temperature. Results were similar in experiments involving both isolated symbionts and symbionts residing within intact tentacles, indicating that the potential stress of symbiont isolation was not a significant factor biasing our results. Despite the lower typical densities of S. muscatinei relative to E. marina, extrapolations of cell-specific H2O2 production rates to the intact symbiosis suggest that S. muscatinei imposes a greater H(2)O(2)burden on A. elegantissima. Even with this burden, however, the considerably higher productivity and fitness of S. muscatinei-bearing anemones documented in prior studies suggests that the net benefit of hosting S. muscatinei exceeds that of E. marina.

Such events have increased in frequency and intensity worldwide in the past decades. Numerous processes involved in Global Change are amplified in the Arctic, but little is known about species specific responses of arctic dinoflagellates. The aim of this work was to perform an exhaustive morphological, phylogenetical and toxinological characterization of Greenland Protoceratium reticulatum and, in addition, to test the effect of temperature on growth and production of bioactive secondary metabolites. Seven clonal isolates, the first isolates of P. reticulatum available from arctic waters, were phylogenetically characterized by analysis of the LSD rDNA. Six isolates were further characterized morphologically and were shown to produce both yessotoxins (YTX) and lytic compounds, representing the first report of allelochemical activity in P. reticulatum. As shown for one of the isolates, growth was strongly affected by temperature with a maximum growth rate at 15 degrees C, a significant but slow growth at 1 degrees C, and cell death at 25 degrees C, suggesting an adaptation of P. reticulatum to temperate waters. Temperature had no major effect on total YTX cell quota or lytic activity but both were affected by the growth phase with a significant increase at stationary phase. A comparison of six isolates at a fixed temperature of 10 degrees C showed high intraspecific variability for all three physiological parameters tested. Growth rate varied from 0.06 to 0.19 d(-1), and total YTX concentration ranged from 0.3 to 15.0 pg YTX cell(-1) and from 0.5 to 31.0 pg YTX cell(-1) at exponential and stationary phase, respectively. All six isolates performed lytic activity; however, for two isolates lytic activity was only detectable at higher cell densities in stationary phase. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, in what way the plankton composition will change as the warming proceeds remains elusive. Here we investigate the chemical signature of the plankton-dominated fraction of particulate organic matter (POM) collected along the Siberian Shelf. POM (>10 mu m) samples were analysed using molecular biomarkers (CuO oxidation and IP25 ) and dual-carbon isotopes (delta C-13 and Delta C-14). In addition, surface water chemical properties were integrated with the POM (>10 mu m) dataset to understand the link between plankton composition and environmental conditions. delta C-13 and Delta C-14 exhibited a large variability in the POM (> 10 mu m) distribution while the content of terrestrial biomarkers in the POM was negligible. In the Laptev Sea (LS), delta C-13 and Delta C-14 of POM (> 10 mu m) suggested a heterotrophic environment in which dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the Lena River was the primary source of metabolisable carbon. Within the Lena plume, terrestrial DOC probably became part of the food web via bacteria uptake and subsequently transferred to relatively other heterotrophic communities (e.g. dinoflagellates). Moving eastwards toward the sea-ice-dominated East Siberian Sea (ESS), the system became progressively more autotrophic. Comparison between delta C-13 of POM (> 10 mu m) samples and CO(2)aq concentrations revealed that the carbon isotope fractionation increased moving towards the easternmost and most productive stations. In a warming scenario characterised by enhanced terrestrial DOC release (thawing permafrost) and progressive sea ice decline, heterotrophic conditions might persist in the LS while the nutrient-rich Pacific inflow will likely stimulate greater primary productivity in the ESS. The contrasting trophic conditions will result in a sharp gradient in delta C-13 between the LS and ESS, similar to what is documented in our semi-synoptic study.","2017-09-18","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","735-748","","5","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000410999500002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;67</p>","","","ARCTIC SHELF; BARENTS SEA; CO2 CONCENTRATION; EXPORT FLUXES; FRESH-WATER; GROWTH-RATE; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; SEA-ICE; TERRESTRIAL CARBON; TERRIGENOUS ORGANIC-MATTER","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the immense genetic and physiological diversity within this family, Symbiodiniaceae community composition has the potential to impact the nutritional physiology and fitness of the cnidarian host and all associated symbionts. Here we assessed the impact of the symbiont community composition on the metabolome of the coralMontipora capitatain Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i, where different colonies can be dominated by stress-tolerantDurusdinium glynniior stress-sensitiveCladocopiumspp. Based on our existing knowledge of these symbiont taxa, we hypothesised that the metabolite profile ofD. glynnii-dominated corals would be consistent with poorer nutritional support of the host relative to those corals dominated byCladocopiumspp. However, comparative metabolite profiling revealed that the metabolite pools of the host and symbiont were unaffected by differences in the abundance of the two symbionts within the community. The abundance of the individual metabolites was the same in the host and in the endosymbiont regardless of whether the host was populated withD. glynniiorCladocopiumspp. These results suggest that coral-dinoflagellate symbioses have the potential to undergo physiological adjustments over time to accommodate differences in their resident symbionts. Such mechanisms may involve host heterotrophic compensation (increasing the level of nutrition generated by feeding relative to delivery from the algae), dynamic regulation of metabolic pathways when exchange of metabolites between the organisms differs, and/or modification of both the type and quantity of metabolites that are exchanged. We discuss these adjustments and the implications for the physiology and survival of reef corals under changing environmental regimes.","2020-12","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","1727-1737","","6","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000565127600002","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;23<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;72</p>","","","CELL BIOLOGY; Cnidarian; CORALS; FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; HOST; Metabolomics; Montipora; MONTIPORA-CAPITATA; RESILIENCE; SPATIAL VARIATION; Symbiodiniaceae; SYMBIONT TYPE; TOLERANCE; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study describes the ability of Aureoumbra lagunensis to enter a resting stage in response to environmental stressors, including high temperature, nutrient depletion, and darkness, as well as their ability to revert from resting cells back to vegetative cells after exposure to optimal light, temperature, and nutrient conditions. Resting cells became round in shape and larger in size, filled with red accumulation bodies, had smaller and fewer plastids, more vacuolar space, contained lower concentrations of chl a and RNA, displayed reduced photosynthetic efficiency, and lower respiration rates relative to vegetative cells. Analysis of vegetative and resting cells using Raman microspectrometry indicated resting cells were enriched in sterols within red accumulation bodies and were depleted in pigments relative to vegetative cells. Upon reverting to vegetative cells, cells increased their chl a content, photosynthetic efficiency, respiration rate, and growth rate and lost accumulation bodies as they became smaller. The time required for resting cells to resume vegetative growth was proportional to both the duration and temperature of dark storage, possibly due to higher metabolic demands on stored energy (sterols) reserves during longer period of storage and/or storage at higher temperature (20 degrees C vs. 10 degrees C). Resting cells kept in the dark at 10 degrees C for 7 months readily reverted back to vegetative cells when transferred to optimal conditions. Thus, the ability of Aureoumbra to form a resting stage likely enables them to form annual blooms within subtropical ecosystems, resist temperature extremes, and may facilitate geographic expansion via anthropogenic transport.","2017-02","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","118-130","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000397259800012","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;17<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;92</p>","","","ALGA AUREOCOCCUS-ANOPHAGEFFERENS; Aureoumbra; brown tide; CELL-FORMATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CYST FORMATION; cysts; DARK SURVIVAL; GROWTH-RATE; harmful algal blooms; metabolism; NITROGEN LIMITATION; PHOTOSYNTHETIC APPARATUS; PHYTOPLANKTON; resting stage; TOXIC DINOFLAGELLATE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exposure to elevated pCO(2) (70.9 Pa) for 28 d led to an increased effective quantum yield of PSII in actinic light within two of the alga-anemone combinations. Autotrophic carbon fixation, along with the rate of carbon translocated to the animal, were significantly elevated with high pCO(2). Elevated pCO(2) exposure also coincided with significantly greater asexual budding rates in all tested anemones. Further, differences in photochemistry and carbon translocation rates suggest subtle differences in the response to pCO(2) among the three strains of S. minutum and their host anemones. This illustrates the potential for physiological diversity at the subspecies level for this ecologically important dinoflagellate.

The genus Symbiodinium exhibits high genetic diversity with physiological variation within and among species, leading to a range of thermal tolerance. Although these variations have been examined in individual species, comprehensive comparative experimental data across several species are still rare. Therefore, in the present study, the photophysiological and thermal response patterns of six genetically characterized Symbiodinium genotypes were comparatively investigated. The six Symbiodinium genotypes were isolated from four different host species from the following biogeographic locations: Hawaii (Central Pacific), Panama (Caribbean), Florida (Caribbean), and Palau (West Pacific). Photosynthesis-irradiance curve and growth measurements at temperatures ranging from 20 to 33 A degrees C were carried out. All physiological data clearly indicate significant differences in the response patterns of the six Symbiodinium genotypes. While some types photosynthesized, respired, and grew at 33 A degrees C, others showed a partial or complete inhibition. The genotype-specific response over the experimental temperature reveals the potential range response of a given symbiont and variation between strains that adaptation might act upon.","2017-08","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","1893-1905","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000405793500017","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;42<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;47<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>","","","ADAPTATION; DIVERSITY; GROWTH-RATE; HOST; Irradiance; Photosynthesis; PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSE; REEF-BUILDING CORALS; Respiration; STRESS; Symbiodinium; SYMBIOTIC ALGAE; Temperature; TEMPERATURE; Tolerance; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This chapter reviews the life history of reef-building corals and the symbiotic relationships between corals and their algal symbionts and discusses possible collaborative defense systems against environmental stresses as well as mechanisms of adaptation to environmental changes in coral-zooxanthella symbiotic systems. Most corals associate with one main type of symbiont, although minor or cryptic symbiont types are often detected within a colony. The association between the coral host and algal symbiont appears to be stable, and the original symbiont often returns when corals recover from bleaching. Some corals, such as the massive Porites, exhibit high fidelity to certain types of algal symbionts and still have high stress tolerance as well as long life spans suggesting the possibility that stem cells and algal symbiont cells in such long-lived colonies accumulate mutations; in turn, if cells with a higher fitness for a new environment proliferate within a colony, the colony may be able to adapt to the new environment.","2016","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","1","","5","","","","CORAL REEF SCIENCE: STRATEGY FOR ECOSYSTEM SYMBIOSIS AND COEXISTENCE WITH HUMANS UNDER MULTIPLE STRESSES","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000388085600002","","","Pages: 24 DOI: 10.1007/978-4-431-54364-0_1","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;13<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;14<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;158</p>","","","ACROPORA-DIGITIFERA GENOME; ALGAL SYMBIOSIS; BLEACHING SUSCEPTIBILITY; DIFFERENTIAL GENE-EXPRESSION; FREE-LIVING SYMBIODINIUM; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN; Life history; Planula; REAL-TIME PCR; Stress response; Symbiosis; SYMBIOTIC SEA-ANEMONE; THERMAL-STRESS; Zooxanthella","","Kayanne, H","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ocean acidification is occurring in all surface waters but the strongest effects will be experienced in polar ecosystems with significant effects on all trophic levels. Brine algae collected from McMurdo Sound (Antarctica) sea ice was incubated in situ under various carbonate chemistry conditions. The carbon chemistry was manipulated with acid, bicarbonate and bases to produce a pCO(2) and pH range from 238 to 6066 mu atm and 7.19 to 8.66, respectively. Elevated pCO(2) positively affected the growth rate of the brine algal community, dominated by the unique ice dinoflagellate, Polarella glacialis. Growth rates were significantly reduced when pH dropped below 7.6. However, when the pH was held constant and the pCO(2) increased, growth rates of the brine algae increased by more than 20% and showed no decline at pCO(2) values more than five times current ambient levels.

Additionally, some corals are able to acclimatize to environmental perturbations by shuffling the relative proportions of different Symbiodinium types hosted. Understanding the dynamics of these symbioses requires a sensitive and quantitative method of Symbiodinium genotyping. Electrophoresis methods, still widely utilized for this purpose, are predominantly qualitative and cannot guarantee detection of a background type below 10% of the total Symbiodinium population. Here, the relative abundances of four Symbiodinium types (A13, C1, C3, and D1) in mixed samples of known composition were quantified using deep sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal RNA gene (ITS-2) by means of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using Roche 454. In samples dominated by each of the four Symbiodinium types tested, background levels of the other three types were detected when present at 5%, 1%, and 0.1% levels, and their relative abundances were quantified with high (A13, C1, D1) to variable (C3) accuracy. The potential of this deep sequencing method for resolving fine-scale genetic diversity within a symbiont type was further demonstrated in a natural symbiosis using ITS-1, and uncovered reef-specific differences in the composition of Symbiodinium microadriaticum in two species of acroporid corals (Acropora digitifera and A. hyacinthus) from Palau. The ability of deep sequencing of the ITS locus (1 and 2) to detect and quantify low-abundant Symbiodinium types, as well as finer-scale diversity below the type level, will enable more robust quantification of local genetic diversity in Symbiodinium populations. This method will help to elucidate the role that background types have in maximizing coral fitness across diverse environments and in response to environmental change.","2014-04-11","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000336736200057","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;86<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;102<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;97</p>","","","ALGAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; CLADE-D; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MONTASTRAEA-ANNULARIS; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; SCLERACTINIAN CORALS; SPECIFICITY; ZOOXANTHELLAE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maintaining the strains at a high abundance (>2000 cells per mL(-1)) for more than 20 months was achieved by feeding them with the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum Lohmann, 1908, along with the addition of the cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia (W.Conrad) D.R.A.Hill, 1992. Toxin production was examined using seven established strains. At the end of the one-month incubation period, the total amounts of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) ranged between 132.0 and 375.0 ng per mL(-1) (n = 7), and 0.7 and 3.6 ng per mL(-1) (n = 3), respectively. Furthermore, only one strain was found to contain a trace level of okadaic acid (OA). Similarly, the cell quota of pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) ranged from 60.6 to 152.4 pg per cell(-1) (n = 7) and 0.5 to 1.2 pg per cell(-1) (n = 3), respectively. The results of this study indicate that toxin production in this species is subject to variation depending on the strain. According to the growth experiment, D. norvegica exhibited a long lag phase, as suggested by the slow growth observed during the first 12 days. In the growth experiment, D. norvegica grew very slowly for the first 12 days, suggesting they had a long lag phase. However, after that, they grew exponentially, with a maximum growth rate of 0.56 divisions per day (during Days 24-27), reaching a maximum concentration of 3000 cells per mL(-1) at the end of the incubation (Day 36). In the toxin production study, the concentration of DTX1 and PTX2 increased following their vegetative growth, but the toxin production still increased exponentially on Day 36 (1.3 ng per mL(-1) and 154.7 ng per mL(-1) of DTX1 and PTX2, respectively). The concentration of OA remained below detectable levels (=0.010 ng per mL(-1)) during the 36-day incubation period, with the exception of Day 6. This study presents new information on the toxin production and content of D. norvegica, as well as insights into the maintenance and culturing of this species.","2023-05-01","2025-03-05 14:40:28","2025-03-05 14:40:28","","","","5","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000998025900001","","","","<p>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Total Times Cited:&nbsp;&nbsp;1<br/>Cited Reference Count:&nbsp;&nbsp;106</p>","","","ACUMINATA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP); DINOFLAGELLATE GENUS DINOPHYSIS; Dinophysis norvegica; dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1); HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; LC-MS/MS ANALYSIS; Mesodinium rubrum; MOLECULAR EVIDENCE; OKADAIC ACID; okadaic acid (OA); PECTENOTOXIN-2; pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2); SHELLFISH; SUCCESSFUL CULTIVATION; Teleaulax amphioxeia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With appropriate conversion factors, numerical species abundance can be expressed as biovolume and then converted to phytoplankton carbon. To-date there has been no attempt to analyze globally distributed phytoplankton data sets to determine the most appropriate species-specific mean cell volume. We have determined phytoplankton cell volumes for 214 of the most common species found in globally distributed coastal time series. The cell volume, carbon/cell and cell density of large diatoms is 200,000, 20,000 and 0.1 times respectively, compared to small diatoms. The cell volume, carbon/cell and cell density of large dinoflagellates is 1500, 1000 and 0.7 times respectively, compared to small dinoflagellates. The range in diatom biovolumes is 100 times greater than across dinoflagellates (i.e. >200,000 vs. 1500 times) and within any diatom species, the range in biovolume is up to 10-fold. Variation in diatom cell volumes are the single largest source of uncertainty in community phytoplankton carbon estimates and greatly exceeds the uncertainty associated with the different volume to carbon estimates. Small diatoms have 10 times more carbon density than large diatoms and small dinoflagellates have 1.5 times more carbon density than large cells. However, carbon density varies relatively little compared to biovolume. We recommend that monthly biovolumes should be determined on field samples, at least for the most important species in each study area, since these measurements will incorporate the effects of variations in light, temperature, nutrients and life cycles. Since biovolumes of diatoms are particularly variable, the use of size classes will help to capture the percentage of large and small cells for each species at certain times of the year. This summary of global datasets of phytoplankton biovolumes is useful in order to evaluate where locally determined biovolumes lie within the global spectrum of spatial and temporal variations and may be used as a species cell volume reference where no locally determined volume estimates are available. There is a need to adopt standard protocols for measuring biovolumes and documenting the accompanying metadata which would improve inter-comparability among time series data sets.

Dinoflagellates were the most commonly detected taxa in both water column and trap samples throughout the time series. Diatom sequences were found only eight times in the water column, and only four times in trap material. Small-sized eukaryotic taxa, including the prasinophyte genera Ostreococcus, Micromonas, and Bathycoccus, were present in trap samples, as were the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Synechococcus was usually overrepresented in trap material, whereas Prochlorococcus was underrepresented compared to the water column. Both seasonal and temporal variability affected patterns of ribosomal DNA found in sediment traps. The two years of this study were quite different hydrographically, with higher storm activity and the passing of a cyclonic eddy causing unusually deep mixing in winter 2010. This was reflected in the DGGE fingerprints of the water column, which showed greater phylotype richness of eukaryotes and a lesser richness of cyanobacteria in winter of 2010 compared with the winter of 2009. Increases in eukaryotic richness could be traced to increased diversity of prasinophytes and prymnesiophytes. The decrease in cyanobacterial richness was in turn reflected in the trap composition, but the increase in eukaryotes was not, indicating a disproportionate contribution of certain taxa to sinking particle flux.
